### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window that contains at most `k` zeros. As we iterate through the array, we will expand the window until we have more than `k` zeros in the window. At this point, we will shrink the window from the left side until we satisfy the constraint of at most `k` zeros in the window again. We will keep track of the maximum window size encountered during the process.

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize variables - `left` pointer, `right` pointer, `zeroCount` to count zeros in the window, and `maxConsecutiveOnes` to store the maximum consecutive ones encountered.
2. Iterate through the array using the `right` pointer and expand the window.
3. If a zero is encountered, increment `zeroCount`.
4. If `zeroCount` exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left side until `zeroCount` is less than or equal to `k`.
5. Update `maxConsecutiveOnes` with the maximum window size.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the end of the array is reached.
7. Return `maxConsecutiveOnes`.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, zeroCount = 0, maxConsecutiveOnes = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
            
            while (zeroCount > k) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            maxConsecutiveOnes = Math.max(maxConsecutiveOnes, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxConsecutiveOnes;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, zeroCount = 0, maxConsecutiveOnes = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
            
            while (zeroCount > k) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            maxConsecutiveOnes = max(maxConsecutiveOnes, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxConsecutiveOnes;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        zeroCount = 0
        maxConsecutiveOnes = 0
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zeroCount += 1
            
            while zeroCount > k:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zeroCount -= 1
                left += 1
            
            maxConsecutiveOnes = max(maxConsecutiveOnes, right - left + 1)
        
        return maxConsecutiveOnes
```
