### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept of remainders and modular arithmetic. We can iterate through the given list of song durations and calculate the remainder when divided by 60. Then, we can count the number of pairs that sum up to a multiple of 60.

We can create a frequency array to store the frequency of remainders encountered so far. For each song duration, we can calculate its remainder when divided by 60. Then, we can check how many other songs can form a pair with it to make the total duration divisible by 60.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] count = new int[60];
        int pairs = 0;
        
        for (int t : time) {
            int remainder = t % 60;
            int complement = (60 - remainder) % 60;
            
            pairs += count[complement];
            count[remainder]++;
        }
        
        return pairs;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        vector<int> count(60, 0);
        int pairs = 0;
        
        for (int t : time) {
            int remainder = t % 60;
            int complement = (60 - remainder) % 60;
            
            pairs += count[complement];
            count[remainder]++;
        }
        
        return pairs;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        count = [0] * 60
        pairs = 0
        
        for t in time:
            remainder = t % 60
            complement = (60 - remainder) % 60
            
            pairs += count[complement]
            count[remainder] += 1
        
        return pairs
```
