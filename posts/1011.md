## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows us to ship all packages within D days. We will define the search space as the range from the maximum weight in the weights array to the sum of all weights in the array. 

For each candidate weight capacity, we simulate the loading process by iterating through the weights array and assigning packages to each day, ensuring that the weight capacity is not exceeded. If we can successfully ship all packages within D days, we move to the left half of the search space to find a smaller weight capacity, otherwise we move to the right half.

We continue this process until we find the minimum weight capacity that allows us to ship all packages within D days.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N * log(sum(weights))), where N is the number of weights and sum(weights) is the sum of all weights in the array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int D) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            left = Math.max(left, weight);
            right += weight;
        }
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int currWeight = 0, days = 1;
            for (int weight : weights) {
                if (currWeight + weight > mid) {
                    days++;
                    currWeight = 0;
                }
                currWeight += weight;
            }
            if (days > D) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int D) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            left = max(left, weight);
            right += weight;
        }
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int currWeight = 0, days = 1;
            for (int weight : weights) {
                if (currWeight + weight > mid) {
                    days++;
                    currWeight = 0;
                }
                currWeight += weight;
            }
            if (days > D) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            curr_weight = 0
            days = 1
            for weight in weights:
                if curr_weight + weight > mid:
                    days += 1
                    curr_weight = 0
                curr_weight += weight
            if days > D:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left
