### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the range of numbers from 1 to n and check if each number has any repeated digits. We can use a helper function to check if a number has repeated digits. This helper function can be implemented using a set to keep track of the digits we have seen so far. If we encounter a digit that is already in the set, then that means the number has repeated digits.

We will count the numbers that have repeated digits and return this count as the final result.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the numbers with repeated digits.
2. Iterate through the numbers from 1 to n.
3. For each number, check if it has repeated digits using the helper function.
4. If the number has repeated digits, increment the `count`.
5. Return the final `count` as the result.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * log(n)), where n is the input number. This is because we are iterating through n numbers and checking each number for repeated digits takes O(log(n)) time complexity.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(log(n)) due to the use of the set to store the digits of each number.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numDupDigitsAtMostN(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (hasRepeatedDigits(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean hasRepeatedDigits(int num) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        while (num > 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;
            if (seen.contains(digit)) {
                return true;
            }
            seen.add(digit);
            num /= 10;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDupDigitsAtMostN(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (hasRepeatedDigits(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    bool hasRepeatedDigits(int num) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        while (num > 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;
            if (seen.count(digit)) {
                return true;
            }
            seen.insert(digit);
            num /= 10;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

    def numDupDigitsAtMostN(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):

                count += 1
        return count
    
    def hasRepeatedDigits(self, num: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while num > 0:
            digit = num % 10
            if digit in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(digit)
            num //= 10
        return False
