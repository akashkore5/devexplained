## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to check if the array can be partitioned into three parts with equal sums. We can achieve this by first calculating the total sum of the array and then searching for two partitions that divide the array into three parts with equal sum.

1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Iterate through the array to find the first partition point where the sum equals one-third of the total sum.
3. Continue iterating to find the second partition point where the sum equals two-thirds of the total sum.

If we successfully find both partition points, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canThreePartsEqualSum(int[] arr) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        if (totalSum % 3 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int partitionSum = totalSum / 3;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int partitionsFound = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum == partitionSum) {
                partitionsFound++;
                currentSum = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return partitionsFound >= 3;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canThreePartsEqualSum(vector<int>& arr) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        if (totalSum % 3 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int partitionSum = totalSum / 3;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int partitionsFound = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum == partitionSum) {
                partitionsFound++;
                currentSum = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return partitionsFound >= 3;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def canThreePartsEqualSum(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        
        if total_sum % 3 != 0:
            return False
        
        partition_sum = total_sum // 3
        current_sum = 0
        partitions_found = 0
        
        for num in arr:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum == partition_sum:
                partitions_found += 1
                current_sum = 0
                
        return partitions_found >= 3
```
