### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the idea of remainders. We iterate through all possible values of n until we find a number that is divisible by k. During each iteration, we calculate the remainder of the current number when divided by k. If the remainder is 0, we return the length of the current number. If we encounter a number that we have already seen before, it means we are in a loop and there is no valid answer.

**Algorithm**:
1. Initialize a remainder variable to 0.
2. Iterate from 1 to k.
3. Calculate the new remainder by multiplying the previous remainder by 10, adding 1, and then taking the modulo k.
4. If the new remainder is 0, return the current iteration count.
5. If we encounter a remainder that we have seen before, return -1.

**Time Complexity**: O(k)  
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        int remainder = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        int remainder = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, k: int) -> int:
        remainder = 0
        for i in range(1, k+1):
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % k
            if remainder == 0:
                return i
        return -1
```
