### Explanation
To convert a number to base -2, we can use the idea of binary representation. We can repeatedly divide the number by -2 and keep track of the remainder. The remainder will be either 0 or 1. If the remainder is negative, we need to add 2 to it and update the number as well. This process continues until the number becomes 0. Then, the remainders in reverse order will give us the base -2 representation of the number.

- Time complexity: O(log n) where n is the input number
- Space complexity: O(log n) to store the remainders
```java
class Solution {
    public String baseNeg2(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return "0";
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (n != 0) {
            int remainder = n % -2;
            n /= -2;
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += 2;
                n += 1;
            }
            sb.append(remainder);
        }
        
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string baseNeg2(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return "0";
        
        string result = "";
        while (n != 0) {
            int remainder = n % -2;
            n /= -2;
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += 2;
                n += 1;
            }
            result = to_string(remainder) + result;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def baseNeg2(self, n: int) -> str:
        if n == 0:
            return "0"
        
        result = ""
        while n != 0:
            remainder = n % -2
            n //= -2
            if remainder < 0:
                remainder += 2
                n += 1
            result = str(remainder) + result
        
        return result
```
