## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree while keeping track of the current binary number formed from the root to the current node. As we traverse the tree, we update the binary number accordingly. When we reach a leaf node, we add the binary number formed from the root to that leaf node to a running sum. Finally, we return the total sum of all the binary numbers formed from root to leaf nodes.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a global variable `totalSum` to store the sum of all binary numbers formed from root to leaf nodes.
2. Implement a recursive DFS function that takes the current node and the binary number formed from the root to the current node as parameters.
3. In the DFS function:
   a. Update the binary number by left shifting it by 1 bit and adding the current node's value.
   b. If the current node is a leaf node, add the binary number to the `totalSum`.
   c. Recursively call the DFS function on the left child (if exists) with the updated binary number.
   d. Recursively call the DFS function on the right child (if exists) with the updated binary number.
4. Return `totalSum` as the final result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the DFS traversal.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This space is used for the recursive call stack during the DFS traversal.
```java
class Solution {
    int totalSum = 0;
    
    public int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, 0);
        return totalSum;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode node, int current) {
        if (node == null) return;
        
        current = (current << 1) | node.val;
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            totalSum += current;
            return;
        }
        
        dfs(node.left, current);
        dfs(node.right, current);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalSum = 0;
    
    int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root, 0);
        return totalSum;
    }
    
    void dfs(TreeNode* node, int current) {
        if (node == nullptr) return;
        
        current = (current << 1) | node->val;
        
        if (node->left == nullptr && node->right == nullptr) {
            totalSum += current;
            return;
        }
        
        dfs(node->left, current);
        dfs(node->right, current);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def sumRootToLeaf(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.totalSum = 0
        
        def dfs(node, current):
            if not node:
                return
            
            current = (current << 1) | node.val
            
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                self.totalSum += current
                return
            
            dfs(node.left, current)
            dfs(node.right, current)
        
        dfs(root, 0)
        return self.totalSum
