### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We need to find the minimum number of clips needed to cover the entire sporting event. We can start by sorting the clips based on their start time. Then, we iterate over the clips to find the clip that can cover the farthest end within the current coverage. If we cannot extend the coverage further, we need to select a new clip that can cover the current end. 

### Algorithm
1. Sort the `clips` array based on the start time.
2. Initialize `end` to 0 to store the current coverage end.
3. Initialize `count` to 0 to store the number of clips used.
4. Iterate over the sorted `clips` array:
   - If the current clip's start time is greater than `end`, return -1 as it means there is a gap in coverage.
   - Update `end` to the maximum of current `end` and current clip's end time.
   - If `end` is greater than or equal to the required `time`, return `count`.
   - Increment `count` by 1.
5. If coverage hasn't reached `time`, return -1 as it is not possible.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn) due to sorting the clips array, where n is the number of clips.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int videoStitching(int[][] clips, int time) {
        Arrays.sort(clips, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int end = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < clips.length; ) {
            if (clips[i][0] > end) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            int newEnd = end;
            while (i < clips.length && clips[i][0] <= end) {
                newEnd = Math.max(newEnd, clips[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            
            count++;
            end = newEnd;
            
            if (end >= time) {
                return count;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp

public:
    int videoStitching(vector<vector<int>>& clips, int time) {
        sort(clips.begin(), clips.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        
        int end = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < clips.size(); ) {
            if (clips[i][0] > end) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            int newEnd = end;
            while (i < clips.size() && clips[i][0] <= end) {
                newEnd = max(newEnd, clips[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            
            count++;
            end = newEnd;
            
            if (end >= time) {
                return count;
            }
        }
