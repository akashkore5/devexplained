### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can observe that the game results in a win for Alice if the number `n` is even. This is because regardless of the move Bob makes, Alice can always choose an `x` that is odd, resulting in an even number for the next turn. Since Bob can only choose odd divisors of an even number, he will eventually end up with an odd number which Alice can then choose an odd divisor for, bringing it back to an even number.

Therefore, the algorithm consists of a simple check to see if `n` is even. If `n` is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

- Time complexity: O(1) as it only involves a simple check.
- Space complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def divisorGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n % 2 == 0
```
