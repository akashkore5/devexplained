### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D dp array where dp[i][diff] represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at index i with a common difference of diff. We iterate through each pair of elements (nums[i] and nums[j], where j < i) and update the dp array accordingly. Finally, we return the maximum value in the dp array as the result.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a 2D dp array of size nums.length x nums.length with all values set to 2 (since we have at least two elements in any subsequence).
2. Initialize a variable `maxLength` to store the result.
3. Iterate over each pair of elements (nums[i] and nums[j]) where j < i:
   - Calculate the common difference diff = nums[i] - nums[j].
   - Update dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j][diff] + 1).
   - Update maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i][diff]).
4. Return maxLength as the final result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array nums.
**Space Complexity:** O(n^2), for the 2D dp array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestArithSeqLength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        int maxLength = 2;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = nums[i] - nums[j];
                dp[i][diff] = Math.max(dp[i][diff], dp[j][diff] + 1);
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i][diff]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 2));
        int maxLength = 2;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = nums[i] - nums[j];
                dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j][diff] + 1);
                maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i][diff]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestArithSeqLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[2 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        maxLength = 2
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                diff = nums[i] - nums[j]
                dp[i][diff] = max(dp[i][diff], dp[j][diff] + 1)
                maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i][diff])
        
        return maxLength
```
