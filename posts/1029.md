## Explanation:
To minimize the total cost, we need to send n people to city A and n people to city B. We can achieve this by sorting the costs based on the difference between the costs of sending a person to city A and city B. We then send the first n people with the smallest differences to city A and the rest to city B.

Steps:
1. Calculate the cost difference for each person (cost of sending to city A - cost of sending to city B).
2. Sort the costs based on the cost difference.
3. Send the first n people to city A and the rest to city B.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - Sorting the costs
Space Complexity: O(n) - for storing the cost differences

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        int n = costs.length / 2;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int[] costDiff = new int[costs.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length; i++) {
            costDiff[i] = costs[i][0] - costs[i][1];
            totalCost += costs[i][1]; // Add costs of sending everyone to city B
        }

        Arrays.sort(costDiff);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += costDiff[i]; // Add costs of sending n people to city A
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int twoCitySchedCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        int n = costs.size() / 2;
        int totalCost = 0;
        vector<int> costDiff(costs.size(), 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < costs.size(); i++) {
            costDiff[i] = costs[i][0] - costs[i][1];
            totalCost += costs[i][1]; // Add costs of sending everyone to city B
        }

        sort(costDiff.begin(), costDiff.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += costDiff[i]; // Add costs of sending n people to city A
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(costs) // 2
        total_cost = 0
        cost_diff = [costs[i][0] - costs[i][1] for i in range(len(costs))]
        
        for i in range(len(costs)):
            total_cost += costs[i][1] # Add costs of sending everyone to city B
        
        cost_diff.sort()
        
        for i in range(n):
            total_cost += cost_diff[i] # Add costs of sending n people to city A
        
        return total_cost
```
