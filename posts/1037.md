### Explanation:
To determine if the given points form a boomerang, we can calculate the slopes of the lines formed by pairs of points. If all three slopes are different, then the points do not lie on a straight line and form a boomerang.

1. Calculate the slopes of the lines formed by each pair of points.
2. Check if all three slopes are distinct.
3. Return true if the slopes are distinct, indicating a boomerang.

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - Since we are dealing with only 3 points, the time complexity is constant.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        return (points[0][0] - points[1][0]) * (points[1][1] - points[2][1]) != (points[1][0] - points[2][0]) * (points[0][1] - points[1][1]);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBoomerang(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        return (points[0][0] - points[1][0]) * (points[1][1] - points[2][1]) != (points[1][0] - points[2][0]) * (points[0][1] - points[1][1]);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isBoomerang(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        return (points[0][0] - points[1][0]) * (points[1][1] - points[2][1]) != (points[1][0] - points[2][0]) * (points[0][1] - points[1][1])
```
