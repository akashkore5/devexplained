## Explanation

To find the maximum depth of a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will recursively traverse the tree, calculating the depth at each node. The maximum depth of the tree is the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 for the current node.

### Algorithm:
1. If the root is null, return 0 as the depth.
2. Recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree.
3. Recursively calculate the maximum depth of the right subtree.
4. Return the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 for the current node.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the space complexity is O(n) for a skewed tree, and in the best case, it is O(log n) for a balanced tree.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);
        
        return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root->left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root->right);
        
        return max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
```
