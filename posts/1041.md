### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the robot based on the given instructions and check if the robot ends up at the initial position and facing the same direction after executing the instructions. If the robot ends up in the same place and facing the same direction after executing all the instructions, then it will be in a circle and will never leave it.

We can keep track of the direction the robot is facing and its coordinates. We iterate through the instructions and update the direction and coordinates accordingly. After iterating through all the instructions, if the robot is either back at the initial position or facing a direction other than north, then it will be in a circle.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables for direction (north by default), x and y coordinates (0, 0).
2. Iterate through the instructions:
   - If the instruction is "G", move the robot one step in the current direction.
   - If the instruction is "L" or "R", update the direction of the robot.
3. After iterating through all instructions, if the robot is back at the initial position or not facing north, return true; otherwise, return false.

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the length of the instructions string.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isRobotBounded(String instructions) {
        int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        int dir = 0; // initially facing north

        for (char instruction : instructions.toCharArray()) {
            if (instruction == 'G') {
                x += directions[dir][0];
                y += directions[dir][1];
            } else if (instruction == 'L') {
                dir = (dir + 3) % 4;
            } else {
                dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
            }
        }

        return (x == 0 && y == 0) || dir != 0;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        int dir = 0; // initially facing north

        for (char instruction : instructions) {
            if (instruction == 'G') {
                x += directions[dir][0];
                y += directions[dir][1];
            } else if (instruction == 'L') {
                dir = (dir + 3) % 4;
            } else {
                dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
            }
        }

        return (x == 0 && y == 0) || dir != 0;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        x, y = 0, 0
        dir = 0  # initially facing north

        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                x += directions[dir][0]
                y += directions[dir][1]
            elif instruction == 'L':
                dir = (dir + 3) % 4
            else:
                dir = (dir + 1) % 4

        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or dir != 0
