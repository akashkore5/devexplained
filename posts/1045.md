### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the customer ids who bought all the products in the Product table. We can achieve this by counting the distinct products bought by each customer and comparing it with the total number of distinct products in the Product table.

**Algorithm:**
1. Count the number of distinct products in the Product table.
2. For each customer, count the number of distinct products they bought.
3. If the count of distinct products bought by a customer is equal to the total number of distinct products, add that customer id to the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the total number of rows in the Customer table.
**Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the result.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM Product);
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM Product);
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM Product);
```
