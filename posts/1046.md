## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a max-heap (priority queue) to store the weights of the stones. We will repeatedly pop the two heaviest stones from the heap, smash them together based on the rules, and then push the resulting weight back into the heap. We will continue this process until there is at most one stone left in the heap.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a max-heap to store the weights of the stones.
2. Insert all the stone weights into the max-heap.
3. While there are at least two stones in the heap, do the following:
   - Pop the two heaviest stones from the heap.
   - If they have different weights, calculate the new weight and push it back into the heap.
4. If there is only one stone left in the heap, return its weight. If the heap is empty, return 0.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) where n is the number of stones, as we perform heap operations for each stone.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) due to the max-heap storing the weights of the stones.

:
:
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        
        for (int stone : stones) {
            maxHeap.offer(stone);
        }
        
        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int y = maxHeap.poll();
            int x = maxHeap.poll();
            
            if (x != y) {
                maxHeap.offer(y - x);
            }
        }
        
        return maxHeap.isEmpty() ? 0 : maxHeap.peek();
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeight(std::vector<int>& stones) {
        std::priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
        
        for (int stone : stones) {
            maxHeap.push(stone);
        }
        
        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int y = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            int x = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            
            if (x != y) {
                maxHeap.push(y - x);
            }
        }
        
        return maxHeap.empty() ? 0 : maxHeap.top();
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        maxHeap = [-stone for stone in stones]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
        
        while len(maxHeap) > 1:
            y = -heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            x = -heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            
            if x != y:
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, -(y - x))
        
        return -maxHeap[0] if maxHeap else 0
```
