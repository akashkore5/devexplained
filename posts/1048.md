### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the words based on their lengths.
2. Initialize a HashMap to store the maximum chain length for each word.
3. For each word in the sorted list:
   - Calculate all possible predecessor words by removing one character at a time.
   - Update the maximum chain length for the current word by finding the maximum of the chain lengths of its predecessors.
4. Return the maximum chain length found in the HashMap.

Time Complexity: O(n * m^2), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of each word.
Space Complexity: O(n)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestStrChain(String[] words) {
        Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparingInt(String::length));
        Map<String, Integer> chainLengths = new HashMap<>();
        int maxChainLength = 1;

        for (String word : words) {
            int currMax = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                StringBuilder predecessor = new StringBuilder(word);
                predecessor.deleteCharAt(i);
                currMax = Math.max(currMax, chainLengths.getOrDefault(predecessor.toString(), 0) + 1);
            }
            chainLengths.put(word, currMax);
            maxChainLength = Math.max(maxChainLength, currMax);
        }

        return maxChainLength;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
            return a.size() < b.size();
        });
        
        unordered_map<string, int> chainLengths;
        int maxChainLength = 1;

        for (const string& word : words) {
            int currMax = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++) {
                string predecessor = word.substr(0, i) + word.substr(i + 1);
                currMax = max(currMax, chainLengths[predecessor] + 1);
            }
            chainLengths[word] = currMax;
            maxChainLength = max(maxChainLength, currMax);
        }

        return maxChainLength;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        words.sort(key=len)
        chain_lengths = {}
        max_chain_length = 1

        for word in words:
            curr_max = 1
            for i in range(len(word)):
                predecessor = word[:i] + word[i+1:]
                curr_max = max(curr_max, chain_lengths.get(predecessor, 0) + 1)
            chain_lengths[word] = curr_max
            max_chain_length = max(max_chain_length, curr_max)

        return max_chain_length
