### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can reframe it as a subset sum problem. We need to divide the stones into two groups such that their weights are as close as possible. This is equivalent to finding a subset with the sum closest to half of the total sum of all stones. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

1. Calculate the total sum of all stones.
2. Initialize a dp array of size half of the total sum + 1 to represent if a subset sum can be achieved using stones.
3. For each stone, update the dp array with the possible subset sums.
4. The answer will be the difference between the total sum and twice the largest subset sum that can be achieved.

Time complexity: O(n * sum/2), where n is the number of stones and sum is the total sum of all stones.
Space complexity: O(sum/2) for the dp array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int stone : stones) {
            totalSum += stone;
        }

        int target = totalSum / 2;
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[target + 1];
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int stone : stones) {
            for (int i = target; i >= stone; i--) {
                dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - stone];
            }
        }

        for (int i = target; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                return totalSum - 2 * i;
            }
        }

        return totalSum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeightII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int totalSum = accumulate(stones.begin(), stones.end(), 0);
        int target = totalSum / 2;
        vector<bool> dp(target + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int stone : stones) {
            for (int i = target; i >= stone; i--) {
                dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - stone];
            }
        }

        for (int i = target; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                return totalSum - 2 * i;
            }
        }

        return totalSum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(stones)
        target = total_sum // 2
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True

        for stone in stones:
            for i in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                dp[i] = dp[i] or dp[i - stone]

        for i in range(target, -1, -1):
            if dp[i]:
                return total_sum - 2 * i

        return total_sum
