## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query to count the number of times each actor cooperated with each director. We can then filter the results to only include pairs where the count is at least 3.
### SQL
```sql
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

```java
// This problem can be solved directly using SQL query, so no Java solution is needed.
```

### C++
```cpp
// This problem can be solved directly using SQL query, so no C++ solution is needed.
```

### Python
