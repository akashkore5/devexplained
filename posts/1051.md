### Explanation:
- We need to compare the current order of students' heights with the expected order.
- To do this, we can create a sorted copy of the expected order and then compare each student's height with the corresponding height in the sorted expected order.
- Count the number of indices where the heights do not match.
 Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] expected = Arrays.copyOf(heights, heights.length);
        Arrays.sort(expected);
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != expected[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++ Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> expected = heights;
        sort(expected.begin(), expected.end());
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
            if (heights[i] != expected[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        expected = sorted(heights)
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            if heights[i] != expected[i]:
                count += 1
                
        return count
```
