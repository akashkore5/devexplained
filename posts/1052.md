### Explanation:
- The problem requires us to find the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day by using a secret technique to remain not grumpy for `minutes` consecutive minutes.
- We can solve this problem by sliding window technique.
- We will iterate through the customers array and calculate the total satisfied customers without using the secret technique.
- Then, we will use a sliding window of size `minutes` to find the maximum number of additional customers that can be satisfied by using the secret technique.
- The maximum satisfied customers will be the sum of total satisfied customers and the additional satisfied customers within the sliding window.

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfied(int[] customers, int[] grumpy, int minutes) {
        int n = customers.length;
        int satisfied = 0;
        int maxAdditionalSatisfied = 0;
        int additionalSatisfied = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
                satisfied += customers[i];
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < minutes; i++) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
                additionalSatisfied += customers[i];
            }
        }
        
        maxAdditionalSatisfied = additionalSatisfied;

                additionalSatisfied += customers[i];
            }
            if (grumpy[i - minutes] == 1) {
                additionalSatisfied -= customers[i - minutes];
            }
            maxAdditionalSatisfied = Math.max(maxAdditionalSatisfied, additionalSatisfied);
