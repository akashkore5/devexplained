### Explanation:

The problem asks to find the minimum number of subsequences of `source` that can be concatenated to form the target string. One subsequence of `source` can be formed by deleting some characters in `source` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the target string and for each character, we try to find the shortest subsequence in `source` that contains this character. We can use a pointer to keep track of our position in `source` while iterating through the target string.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `result` to keep track of the number of subsequences needed.
2. Initialize a pointer `index` to 0.
3. Iterate through the target string:
    - For each character in the target string, find the shortest subsequence in `source` starting from the current position `index` that contains the current character.
    - If we cannot find the character in `source` starting from `index`, increment `result` and reset the pointer `index` to 0.
    - Otherwise, update the `index` to the next character position in `source`.
4. Return the `result`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(M*N), where M is the length of the target string and N is the length of the source string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestWay(String source, String target) {
        int result = 0;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < target.length()) {
            int start = index;
            for (int i = 0; i < source.length(); i++) {
                if (index < target.length() && source.charAt(i) == target.charAt(index)) {
                    index++;
                }
            }
            if (index == start) {
                return -1;
            }
            result++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWay(string source, string target) {
        int result = 0;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < target.length()) {
            int start = index;
            for (int i = 0; i < source.length(); i++) {
                if (index < target.length() && source[i] == target[index]) {
                    index++;
                }
            }
            if (index == start) {
                return -1;
            }
            result++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        result = 0
        index = 0
        
        while index < len(target):
            start = index
            for i in range(len(source)):
                if index < len(target) and source[i] == target[index]:
                    index += 1
            if index == start:
                return -1
            result += 1
        
        return result
```
