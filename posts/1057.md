## Explanation:

The problem asks to assign each bike to the closest worker based on the Manhattan distance between them. Each worker can only choose one bike, but one bike can be assigned to multiple workers. We need to find the worker-bike pairs that minimize the total Manhattan distance.

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to store the distances between each worker and each bike. We will iterate through each worker and for each worker, we will calculate the Manhattan distance to all bikes and store these distances in the priority queue. Then, we will go through the priority queue and assign bikes to workers based on the minimum distance while ensuring that each bike is assigned to at most one worker.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] assignBikes(int[][] workers, int[][] bikes) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            int comp = Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
            if (comp == 0) {
                if (a[1] == b[1]) {
                    return Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]);
                }
                return Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]);
            }
            return comp;
        });

        for (int i = 0; i < workers.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < bikes.length; j++) {
                int dist = Math.abs(workers[i][0] - bikes[j][0]) + Math.abs(workers[i][1] - bikes[j][1]);
                pq.offer(new int[]{dist, i, j});
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[workers.length];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);
        Set<Integer> bikeAssigned = new HashSet<>();
        while (bikeAssigned.size() < workers.length) {
            int[] assign = pq.poll();
            if (result[assign[1]] == -1 && !bikeAssigned.contains(assign[2])) {
                result[assign[1]] = assign[2];
                bikeAssigned.add(assign[2]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> assignBikes(vector<vector<int>>& workers, vector<vector<int>>& bikes) {
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, greater<vector<int>>> pq;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < workers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < bikes.size(); j++) {
                int dist = abs(workers[i][0] - bikes[j][0]) + abs(workers[i][1] - bikes[j][1]);
                pq.push({dist, i, j});
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> result(workers.size(), -1);
        unordered_set<int> bikeAssigned;
        while (bikeAssigned.size() < workers.size()) {
            vector<int> assign = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            if (result[assign[1]] == -1 && !bikeAssigned.count(assign[2])) {
                result[assign[1]] = assign[2];
                bikeAssigned.insert(assign[2]);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        pq = []
        for i, worker in enumerate(workers):
            for j, bike in enumerate(bikes):
                dist = abs(worker[0] - bike[0]) + abs(worker[1] - bike[1])
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist, i, j))
        
        result = [-1] * len(workers)
        bike_assigned = set()
        while len(bike_assigned) < len(workers):
            dist, worker, bike = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if result[worker] == -1 and bike not in bike_assigned:
                result[worker] = bike
                bike_assigned.add(bike)
        
        return result
```
