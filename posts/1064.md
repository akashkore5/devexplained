## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and check if the value at any index is equal to the index itself. If we find such an index, it is a fixed point, and we can return that index. If we don't find any fixed point, we return -1.

The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, so we can utilize this property and optimize our solution by using binary search. By comparing the value at the mid index with the index itself, we can determine whether the fixed point lies to the left or right of the mid index.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `arr.length - 1`.
2. While `left <= right`:
   a. Calculate `mid` as `(left + right) / 2`.
   b. If `arr[mid] == mid`, return `mid`.
   c. If `arr[mid] < mid`, set `left = mid + 1`.
   d. If `arr[mid] > mid`, set `right = mid - 1`.
3. If no fixed point is found, return -1.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) as we are using binary search.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.
```java
class Solution {
    public int fixedPoint(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == mid) {
                return mid;
            } else if (arr[mid] < mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int fixedPoint(vector<int>& arr) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == mid) {
                return mid;
            } else if (arr[mid] < mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def fixedPoint(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if arr[mid] == mid:
                return mid
            elif arr[mid] < mid:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return -1
```
