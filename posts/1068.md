### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to join the Sales table with the Product table based on the product_id, and then select the product_name, year, and price for each sale_id in the Sales table.

We will perform a simple join operation on the Sales and Product tables using the product_id column. The resulting table will have columns - product_name, year, and price.
