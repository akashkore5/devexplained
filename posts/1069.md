## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to write a SQL query that calculates the total sales amount for each product in the `Sales` table. The `Sales` table contains two columns: `product_id` and `quantity`.

We can achieve this by using the `GROUP BY` clause along with the `SUM` function to calculate the total sales amount for each product.
### SQL

```sql
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_amount
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id;
