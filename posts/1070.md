### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to select the product id, year, quantity, and price for the first year of every product sold. We can achieve this by using a SQL query to join the Sales and Product tables, filter the results to only include the first year of each product, and then display the required columns.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT p.product_id, s.year AS first_year, s.quantity, s.price
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE (s.product_id, s.year) IN (
    SELECT product_id, MIN(year)
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY product_id
)
```
:
```java
// SQL query is not directly executable in Java, use JDBC to execute the query
// Make sure to have a JDBC connection and execute the above SQL query
// Here is a basic outline using JDBC:

import java.sql.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db", "username", "password");
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();

            String query = "SELECT p.product_id, s.year AS first_year, s.quantity, s.price " +
                    "FROM Sales s " +
                    "JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id " +
                    "WHERE (s.product_id, s.year) IN (" +
                    "   SELECT product_id, MIN(year) " +
                    "   FROM Sales " +
                    "   GROUP BY product_id" +
                    ")";

            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);

            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println(rs.getInt("product_id") + " " + rs.getInt("first_year") + " " + rs.getInt("quantity") + " " + rs.getInt("price"));
            }

            conn.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
// SQL query is not directly executable in C++, use a library like SQLiteCpp to execute the query
// Refer to the library documentation to set up the database connection and execute the query

#include <iostream>
#include <SQLiteCpp/SQLiteCpp.h>

int main() {
    SQLite::Database db("your_db.db", SQLite::OPEN_READWRITE);

    SQLite::Statement query(db, "SELECT p.product_id, s.year AS first_year, s.quantity, s.price "
                                "FROM Sales s "
                                "JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id "
                                "WHERE (s.product_id, s.year) IN ("
                                "   SELECT product_id, MIN(year) "
                                "   FROM Sales "
                                "   GROUP BY product_id"
                                ")");

    while (query.executeStep()) {
        std::cout << query.getColumn(0) << " " << query.getColumn(1) << " " << query.getColumn(2) << " " << query.getColumn(3) << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Python:
```python
# SQL query is not directly executable in Python, use a library like sqlite3 to execute the query
# Make sure to have a SQLite database set up and connected

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_db.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

query = "SELECT p.product_id, s.year AS first_year, s.quantity, s.price " + \
        "FROM Sales s " + \
        "JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id " + \
        "WHERE (s.product_id, s.year) IN (" + \
        "   SELECT product_id, MIN(year) " + \
        "   FROM Sales " + \
        "   GROUP BY product_id" + \
        ")"

cursor.execute(query)
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

conn.close()
```
