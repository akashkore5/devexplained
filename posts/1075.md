### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average experience years of all employees for each project. We can achieve this by joining the Project table with the Employee table on the employee_id column. Then, we group the results by project_id and calculate the average experience years for each project.

```java
SELECT project_id, ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY project_id;
```

#### C++
```cpp
SELECT project_id, ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY project_id;
```

#### Python
```python
SELECT project_id, ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY project_id;
```
