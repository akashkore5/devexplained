## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of employees who have worked on each project. Given a table `Project`, where each row contains the project_id and employee_id, we can use SQL to group the data by project_id and count the number of employees for each project.

We can achieve this by writing a SQL query that groups the rows by project_id and computes the count of distinct employee_id for each project_id.

:

### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT project_id, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id;
```
