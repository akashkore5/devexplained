## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of employees who have worked on each project. We can achieve this by using a SQL query with a group by clause on the project_id column and then summing up the distinct employee_id for each project.

1. Write a SQL query to group by project_id and count the distinct employee_id for each project.
2. Return the result as the output.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the table.
Space complexity: O(n)
```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT project_id, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS number_of_employees
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
```

### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT project_id, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS number_of_employees
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
```

### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT project_id, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS number_of_employees
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
```
