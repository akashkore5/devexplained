## Explanation

The problem requires us to find the IDs of customers who have made more than one transaction. We are given a table `Orders` with columns `customer_id` and `order_id`. 

To solve this problem, we can use SQL to group the data by `customer_id` and count the number of orders made by each customer. We can then filter the results to include only those customers who have made more than one transaction.
### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1
``````java
// Java solution
// Note: JDBC connection and result set handling is not included in this code snippet

String sqlQuery = "SELECT customer_id FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1";
PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sqlQuery);
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();

while (rs.next()) {
    int customerId = rs.getInt("customer_id");
    System.out.println(customerId);
}

```

### C++

```cpp
// C++ solution
// Note: Database connection and query execution code is not included in this code snippet

string sqlQuery = "SELECT customer_id FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1";
// Execute the query and fetch results

```

### Python

```python
# Python solution
# Note: Database connection and cursor handling is not included in this code snippet

sql_query = "SELECT customer_id FROM Orders GROUP BY customer_id HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1"
cursor.execute(sql_query)

for row in cursor.fetchall():
    customer_id = row[0]
    print(customer_id)
```
