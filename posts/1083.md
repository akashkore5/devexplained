### Explanation:
- We are given a table `Product` with columns `product_id` and `product_name`, and another table `Sales` with columns `sale_id`, `product_id`, and `year`.
- We need to write a SQL query to find the total sales amount of each product for each year.

:

```java
SELECT product_id, year, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id, year;
```

```cpp
SELECT product_id, year, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id, year;
```

```python
SELECT product_id, year, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id, year;
```
