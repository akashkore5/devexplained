### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019 by checking the sales table for each product's sale date. We can achieve this by using SQL queries to filter out the products that were sold outside the specified date range.

```java
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM Product p
LEFT JOIN Sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.sale_date >= '2019-01-01' AND s.sale_date <= '2019-03-31'
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
HAVING COUNT(s.sale_date) = 1
```

#### C++
```cpp
SELECT Product.product_id, Product.product_name
FROM Product
LEFT JOIN Sales ON Product.product_id = Sales.product_id
WHERE Sales.sale_date >= '2019-01-01' AND Sales.sale_date <= '2019-03-31'
GROUP BY Product.product_id, Product.product_name
HAVING COUNT(Sales.sale_date) = 1
```

#### Python
```python
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM Product
LEFT JOIN Sales ON Product.product_id = Sales.product_id
WHERE sale_date >= '2019-01-01' AND sale_date <= '2019-03-31'
GROUP BY product_id, product_name
HAVING COUNT(sale_date) = 1
```
