## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the car's journey along the road and keep track of the number of passengers at each location. We will iterate over the trips array, incrementing the passenger count at the pickup location and decrementing it at the drop-off location. At each step, we check if the total number of passengers exceeds the car's capacity. If it does, we return false, indicating that it is not possible to pick up and drop off all passengers. If we complete all trips without exceeding the capacity at any point, we return true.

- We need to keep track of the passenger count at each location.
- Iterate over the trips and update the passenger count accordingly.
- Check if the passenger count exceeds the capacity at any point.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of trips.
Space Complexity: O(maximum location), where maximum location is the maximum value of any location in the trips.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        int[] passengerCount = new int[1001];
        for (int[] trip : trips) {
            passengerCount[trip[1]] += trip[0];
            passengerCount[trip[2]] -= trip[0];
        }
        
        int currPassengers = 0;
        for (int count : passengerCount) {
            currPassengers += count;
            if (currPassengers > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
        vector<int> passengerCount(1001, 0);
        for (const auto& trip : trips) {
            passengerCount[trip[1]] += trip[0];
            passengerCount[trip[2]] -= trip[0];
        }
        
        int currPassengers = 0;
        for (int count : passengerCount) {
            currPassengers += count;
            if (currPassengers > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        passenger_count = [0] * 1001
        for trip in trips:
            passenger_count[trip[1]] += trip[0]
            passenger_count[trip[2]] -= trip[0]
        
        curr_passengers = 0
        for count in passenger_count:
            curr_passengers += count
            if curr_passengers > capacity:
                return False
        
        return True
```
