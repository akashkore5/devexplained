## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of players who played each day and stopped playing the next day. We can iterate through the logs and keep track of the players who played on a particular day but did not play the next day. Finally, we count the unique players who satisfy this condition.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a set to store the players who stopped playing the next day.
2. Iterate through the logs and check if a player played on a particular day but did not play the next day. If so, add the player to the set.
3. Return the size of the set as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of logs.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the set storing the players.
```java
class Solution {
    public int mostVisited(int n, int[] rounds) {
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        int start = rounds[0];
        int end = rounds[rounds.length - 1];
        
        if (start <= end) {
            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
                visited.add(i);
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= end; i++) {
                visited.add(i);
            }
            for (int i = start; i <= n; i++) {
                visited.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(visited);
        Collections.sort(list);
        return list;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        set<int> visited;
        int start = rounds[0];
        int end = rounds[rounds.size() - 1];
        
        if (start <= end) {
            for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
                visited.insert(i);
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 1; i <= end; ++i) {
                visited.insert(i);
            }
            for (int i = start; i <= n; ++i) {
                visited.insert(i);
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> result(visited.begin(), visited.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def mostVisited(self, n: int, rounds: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        visited = set()
        start = rounds[0]
        end = rounds[-1]
        
        if start <= end:
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                visited.add(i)
        else:
            for i in range(1, end + 1):
                visited.add(i)
            for i in range(start, n + 1):
                visited.add(i)
        
        return sorted(list(visited))
