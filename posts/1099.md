## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We first sort the input array in ascending order. Then, we initialize two pointers `left` and `right` at the beginning and end of the sorted array respectively. We iterate through the array and move the pointers based on the sum of the elements pointed by them. If the sum is less than `K`, we update the maximum sum found so far and move the `left` pointer to the right. Otherwise, we move the `right` pointer to the left. We continue this process until the two pointers meet or pass each other.

Finally, we return the maximum sum found which is less than `K`, or -1 if no such sum exists.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int twoSumLessThanK(int[] nums, int K) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        int maxSum = -1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum < K) {
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int twoSumLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int K) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        int maxSum = -1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum < K) {
                maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSumLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        maxSum = -1
        
        while left < right:
            sum_val = nums[left] + nums[right]
            if sum_val < K:
                maxSum = max(maxSum, sum_val)
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return maxSum
```
