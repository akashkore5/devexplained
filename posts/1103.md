### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to distribute a given number of candies to a row of people in a specific manner. We iterate through the people in a cyclic manner, giving each person candies in increasing amounts until we run out of candies. We can determine the number of candies each person receives by simulating the distribution process. 

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize an array to store the final distribution of candies to each person.
2. Start with 1 candy and distribute candies in a cyclic manner to each person until all candies are distributed.
3. Keep track of the remaining candies and the index of the current person to whom candies are being distributed.
4. Update the array with the distributed candies for each person.
5. Repeat the process until all candies are distributed.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(candies)) since we distribute candies in a cyclic manner until all candies are distributed.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(num_people) to store the final distribution of candies.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        int[] distribution = new int[num_people];
        int currCandies = 1;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (candies > 0) {
            distribution[index % num_people] += Math.min(currCandies, candies);
            candies -= currCandies;
            currCandies++;
            index++;
        }
        
        return distribution;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        vector<int> distribution(num_people, 0);
        int currCandies = 1;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (candies > 0) {
            distribution[index % num_people] += min(currCandies, candies);
            candies -= currCandies;
            currCandies++;
            index++;
        }
        
        return distribution;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, candies: int, num_people: int) -> List[int]:
        distribution = [0] * num_people
        curr_candies = 1
        index = 0
        
        while candies > 0:
            distribution[index % num_people] += min(curr_candies, candies)
            candies -= curr_candies
            curr_candies += 1
            index += 1
        
        return distribution
```
