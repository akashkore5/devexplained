### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to split the given valid parentheses string (`seq`) into two disjoint subsequences (`A` and `B`) such that the maximum depth of the two subsequences is minimized. We can achieve this by allocating parentheses alternatively to subsequences `A` and `B`. This way, we can balance the nesting depth between the two subsequences.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Iterate over the characters in the input string `seq`.
2. Assign the characters to subsequences `A` and `B` alternatively based on their index.
3. Whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`, we increment the depth counter.
4. To balance the depth between `A` and `B`, we assign the character to the subsequence with the lower current depth.
5. Return the resulting answer array.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `seq`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) to store the answer array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq) {
        int n = seq.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int depth = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = seq.charAt(i);
            if (c == '(') {
                depth++;
                ans[i] = depth % 2;
            } else {
                ans[i] = depth % 2;
                depth--;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxDepthAfterSplit(string seq) {
        int n = seq.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);
        int depth = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = seq[i];
            if (c == '(') {
                depth++;
                ans[i] = depth % 2;
            } else {
                ans[i] = depth % 2;
                depth--;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepthAfterSplit(self, seq: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(seq)
        ans = [0] * n
        depth = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            c = seq[i]
            if c == '(':
                depth += 1
                ans[i] = depth % 2
            else:
                ans[i] = depth % 2
                depth -= 1
        
        return ans
```
