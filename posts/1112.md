### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the highest grade for each student in a table where the rows represent students and the columns represent exams. We can iterate through each column and keep track of the highest grade for each student.

1. Create a map where the key is the student id and the value is the highest grade.
2. Iterate through each row of the table.
3. For each student id, update the highest grade if the current grade is higher.
4. Finally, return the map with the highest grade for each student.

Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n is the number of students and m is the number of exams.  
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of students.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public Map<Integer, Integer> highestGradeForEachStudent(int[][] table) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> highestGrades = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int[] row : table) {
            int studentId = row[0];
            int grade = row[1];
            
            highestGrades.put(studentId, highestGrades.getOrDefault(studentId, 0) < grade ? grade : highestGrades.getOrDefault(studentId, 0));
        }
        
        return highestGrades;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    map<int, int> highestGradeForEachStudent(vector<vector<int>>& table) {
        map<int, int> highestGrades;
        
        for (auto& row : table) {
            int studentId = row[0];
            int grade = row[1];
            
            highestGrades[studentId] = max(grade, highestGrades[studentId]);
        }
        
        return highestGrades;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def highestGradeForEachStudent(self, table: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
        highest_grades = {}
        
        for row in table:
            student_id = row[0]
            grade = row[1]
            
            highest_grades[student_id] = max(grade, highest_grades.get(student_id, 0))
        
        return highest_grades
```
