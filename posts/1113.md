## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate over the list of reported posts and maintain a count of each post's report count. Then, we can iterate over the list of posts and check if the post has been reported more than the threshold. If so, we add it to the result list.

### Algorithm
1. Create a map to store the count of each reported post.
2. Iterate over the list of reported posts and update the count in the map.
3. Iterate over the list of posts and check if the post has been reported more than the threshold.
4. If the count exceeds the threshold, add the post to the result list.
5. Return the result list.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the total number of reported posts and posts.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the total number of reported posts.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> reportPosts(int[] reported, int[] posts, int threshold) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> reportCount = new HashMap<>();
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int report : reported) {
            reportCount.put(report, reportCount.getOrDefault(report, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int post : posts) {
            if (reportCount.containsKey(post) && reportCount.get(post) >= threshold) {
                result.add(post);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> reportPosts(std::vector<int>& reported, std::vector<int>& posts, int threshold) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> reportCount;
        std::vector<int> result;
        
        for (int report : reported) {
            reportCount[report]++;
        }
        
        for (int post : posts) {
            if (reportCount.find(post) != reportCount.end() && reportCount[post] >= threshold) {
                result.push_back(post);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def reportPosts(self, reported: List[int], posts: List[int], threshold: int) -> List[int]:
        report_count = Counter(reported)
        result = []
        
        for post in posts:
            if post in report_count and report_count[post] >= threshold:
                result.append(post)
        
        return result
```
