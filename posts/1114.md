## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use synchronization mechanisms such as `CountDownLatch` or `Semaphore` to ensure that the methods are called in the correct order. We can have a `CountDownLatch` for each method, and the `CountDownLatch` of one method will only be released after the previous method has been called. This approach guarantees the correct order of execution.

1. We initialize three `CountDownLatch` objects, one for each method: `firstLatch`, `secondLatch`, and `thirdLatch`.
2. In the `first` method, we print "first" and then release the `secondLatch`.
3. In the `second` method, we wait for the `secondLatch` to be released, print "second", and then release the `thirdLatch`.
4. In the `third` method, we wait for the `thirdLatch` to be released and then print "third".

This approach ensures that the methods are called in the correct order regardless of the scheduling of the threads.

- Time complexity: O(1) for each method call.
- Space complexity: O(1).

:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

class Foo {
    private CountDownLatch firstLatch;
    private CountDownLatch secondLatch;

    public Foo() {
        firstLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
        secondLatch = new CountDownLatch(1);
    }

    public void first() {
        System.out.print("first");
        firstLatch.countDown();
    }

    public void second() throws InterruptedException {
        firstLatch.await();
        System.out.print("second");
        secondLatch.countDown();
    }

    public void third() throws InterruptedException {
        secondLatch.await();
        System.out.print("third");
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

class Foo {
private:
    std::mutex mtx;
    std::condition_variable cv;
    int order = 1;

public:
    Foo() {}

    void first() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        while (order != 1) {
            cv.wait(lock);
        }
        std::cout << "first";
        order = 2;
        cv.notify_all();
    }

    void second() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        while (order != 2) {
            cv.wait(lock);
        }
        std::cout << "second";
        order = 3;
        cv.notify_all();
    }

    void third() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        while (order != 3) {
            cv.wait(lock);
        }
        std::cout << "third";
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
from threading import Condition

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cv = Condition()
        self.order = 1

    def first(self):
        with self.cv:
            while self.order != 1:
                self.cv.wait()
            print("first", end="")
            self.order = 2
            self.cv.notify_all()

    def second(self):
        with self.cv:
            while self.order != 2:
                self.cv.wait()
            print("second", end="")
            self.order = 3
            self.cv.notify_all()

    def third(self):
        with self.cv:
            while self.order != 3:
                self.cv.wait()
            print("third", end="")
