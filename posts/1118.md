# Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days in a given month and year. We can achieve this by considering leap years and non-leap years. For non-leap years, each month has a fixed number of days. For leap years, we need to consider the special case of February having 29 days.

The algorithm involves the following steps:
1. Check if the given year is a leap year.
2. Based on the month index, return the number of days in that month accounting for leap years.

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfDays(int Y, int M) {
        int[] daysInMonth = new int[]{0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        if (M == 2 && (Y % 4 == 0 && Y % 100 != 0 || Y % 400 == 0)) {
            return 29;
        }
        return daysInMonth[M];
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfDays(int Y, int M) {
        int daysInMonth[] = {0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        if (M == 2 && (Y % 4 == 0 && Y % 100 != 0 || Y % 400 == 0)) {
            return 29;
        }
        return daysInMonth[M];
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfDays(self, Y: int, M: int) -> int:
        daysInMonth = [0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
        if M == 2 and (Y % 4 == 0 and Y % 100 != 0 or Y % 400 == 0):
            return 29
        return daysInMonth[M]
```
