## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to keep track of the cumulative difference between tiring and non-tiring days. We iterate through the given hours array, keeping track of the cumulative sum and the first occurrence of each cumulative sum in the hashmap. If at any point the current cumulative sum is greater than a previous cumulative sum by at least 1, that means we have found a well-performing interval. We then update the result with the maximum length of such intervals.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their indices.
2. Initialize a variable `result` to store the maximum length of well-performing intervals.
3. Initialize a variable `cumulative` to keep track of the cumulative difference.
4. Iterate through the given `hours` array.
   - Increment `cumulative` by 1 if the current hour is greater than 8, otherwise decrement by 1.
   - If `cumulative` is greater than 0, update `result` to current index + 1.
   - If `cumulative` is not present in the hashmap, store its index.
5. Return the `result`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `hours` array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) for the hashmap.
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestWPI(int[] hours) {
        int result = 0;
        int cumulative = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < hours.length; i++) {
            cumulative += hours[i] > 8 ? 1 : -1;
            if (cumulative > 0) {
                result = i + 1;
            }
            map.putIfAbsent(cumulative, i);
            if (map.containsKey(cumulative - 1)) {
                result = Math.max(result, i - map.get(cumulative - 1));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {
        int result = 0;
        int cumulative = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        for (int i = 0; i < hours.size(); i++) {
            cumulative += hours[i] > 8 ? 1 : -1;
            if (cumulative > 0) {
                result = i + 1;
            }
            if (map.find(cumulative) == map.end()) {
                map[cumulative] = i;
            }
            if (map.find(cumulative - 1) != map.end()) {
                result = max(result, i - map[cumulative - 1]);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def longestWPI(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        cumulative = 0
        map = {}
        for i, hour in enumerate(hours):
            cumulative += 1 if hour > 8 else -1
            if cumulative > 0:
                result = i + 1
            if cumulative not in map:
                map[cumulative] = i
            if cumulative - 1 in map:
                result = max(result, i - map[cumulative - 1])
        return result
