### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach with bit manipulation. We will create a bitmask to represent the set of skills covered by each possible team. We will iterate through all possible combinations of team members and update the bitmask accordingly. By doing so, we can find the smallest sufficient team that covers all required skills.

1. **Create a mapping of skills to their indices** to easily convert between skill names and their corresponding bit positions in the bitmask.
2. **Initialize a dp array** where dp[mask] stores the minimum number of team members required to cover all skills represented by the bitmask.
3. **Iterate through each person** and update the dp array based on the skills they possess.
4. **Update the dp array** by considering the current person in or out of the team, based on whether adding them helps in covering more skills.
5. **Finally, reconstruct the smallest sufficient team** by backtracking through the dp array.

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n * m), where n is the number of people and m is the number of required skills.  
**Space Complexity:** O(2^n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] smallestSufficientTeam(String[] req_skills, List<List<String>> people) {
        int n = req_skills.length;
        Map<String, Integer> skillMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            skillMap.put(req_skills[i], i);
        }
        
        int[] dp = new int[1 << n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        List<Integer>[] teamMembers = new List[1 << n];
        Arrays.fill(teamMembers, new ArrayList<>());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (String skill : people.get(i)) {
                mask |= 1 << skillMap.get(skill);
            }
            
            for (int prev = 0; prev < dp.length; prev++) {
                if (dp[prev] + 1 < dp[prev | mask]) {
                    dp[prev | mask] = dp[prev] + 1;
                    teamMembers[prev | mask] = new ArrayList<>(teamMembers[prev]);
                    teamMembers[prev | mask].add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = teamMembers[(1 << n) - 1];
        int[] resArray = new int[result.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            resArray[i] = result.get(i);
        }
        
        return resArray;
    }
}
```

```cpp

public:
    vector<int> smallestSufficientTeam(vector<string>& req_skills, vector<vector<string>>& people) {
        int n = req_skills.size();
        unordered_map<string, int> skillMap;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            skillMap[req_skills[i]] = i;
        }
        
        vector<int> dp(1 << n, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        vector<vector<int>> teamMembers(1 << n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
            int mask = 0;
            for (string skill : people[i]) {
                mask |= 1 << skillMap[skill];
            }
            
            for (int prev = 0; prev < dp.size(); prev++) {
                if (dp[prev] + 1 < dp[prev | mask]) {
                    dp[prev | mask] = dp[prev] + 1;
                    teamMembers[prev | mask] = teamMembers[prev];
                    teamMembers[prev | mask].push_back(i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return teamMembers[(1 << n) - 1];

            for prev in range(len(dp)):
                if dp[prev] + 1 < dp[prev | mask]:
                    dp[prev | mask] = dp[prev] + 1
                    teamMembers[prev | mask] = teamMembers[prev] + [i]
