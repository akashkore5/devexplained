### Explanation:

Given a list of closed intervals `businesses`, find the number of active businesses at each time point. The active businesses are defined as the number of intervals that contain the current time point.

To solve this problem, we can use a sweep line algorithm. We iterate through all the time points, maintaining a count of active businesses using a map. We update the count of active businesses based on the start and end times of each interval.

1. Initialize a map to store the count of active businesses at each time point.
2. Iterate through all intervals in the input list:
   - Increment the count in the map at the start time of the interval.
   - Decrement the count in the map at the end time of the interval.
3. Iterate through the map and update the count of active businesses for each time point based on the accumulated sum.
4. Return the list of active businesses at each time point.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of intervals. The sorting of intervals takes O(n log n) time complexity.
Space complexity: O(n) for the map to store active businesses.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> activeBusinesses(int[][] businesses) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        
        for (int[] business : businesses) {
            map.put(business[0], map.getOrDefault(business[0], 0) + 1);
            map.put(business[1], map.getOrDefault(business[1], 0) - 1);
        }
        
        int activeCount = 0;
        for (int count : map.values()) {
            activeCount += count;
            result.add(activeCount);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> activeBusinesses(vector<vector<int>>& businesses) {
        vector<int> result;
        map<int, int> mp;
        
        for (auto& business : businesses) {
            mp[business[0]]++;
            mp[business[1]]--;
        }
        
        int activeCount = 0;
        for (auto& it : mp) {
            activeCount += it.second;
            result.push_back(activeCount);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def activeBusinesses(self, businesses: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        mp = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        for business in businesses:
            mp[business[0]] += 1
            mp[business[1]] -= 1
        
        active_count = 0
        for count in sorted(mp.keys()):
            active_count += mp[count]
            result.append(active_count)
        
        return result
```
