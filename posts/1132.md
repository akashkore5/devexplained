### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the number of users that have been reported at least `N` times consecutively.

We can solve this problem by iterating through the array of report counts and checking if the current count is greater than or equal to `N` and the previous count was also greater than or equal to `N`. If this condition is met, we increment a counter for the number of users meeting the criteria.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize a counter variable `consecutiveUsers` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array of report counts.
3. Check if the current count is greater than or equal to `N` and the previous count was also greater than or equal to `N`.
4. If the condition is met, increment `consecutiveUsers`.
5. Return `consecutiveUsers`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the reportCounts array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getConsecutiveUsers(int[] reportCounts, int N) {
        int consecutiveUsers = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < reportCounts.length; i++) {
            if (reportCounts[i] >= N && reportCounts[i - 1] >= N) {
                consecutiveUsers++;
            }
        }
        return consecutiveUsers;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getConsecutiveUsers(vector<int>& reportCounts, int N) {
        int consecutiveUsers = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < reportCounts.size(); i++) {
            if (reportCounts[i] >= N && reportCounts[i - 1] >= N) {
                consecutiveUsers++;
            }
        }
        return consecutiveUsers;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getConsecutiveUsers(self, reportCounts: List[int], N: int) -> int:
        consecutiveUsers = 0
        for i in range(1, len(reportCounts)):
            if reportCounts[i] >= N and reportCounts[i - 1] >= N:
                consecutiveUsers += 1
        return consecutiveUsers
```
