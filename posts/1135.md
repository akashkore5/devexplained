## Explanation:

Given a list of connections between cities and their costs, we need to find the minimum cost to connect all cities such that there is at least one path between any two cities.

To solve this problem, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The idea is to sort the connections based on their costs in ascending order and then iterate through them to build the minimum spanning tree.

Algorithm:
1. Sort the connections based on their costs.
2. Initialize an array to keep track of the parent of each city.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total cost.
4. Iterate through the sorted connections:
   - Find the parents of the two cities connected by the current connection.
   - If the two cities have different parents, update the parent of one city to be the parent of the other city and add the cost of the connection to the total cost.
5. After processing all connections, check if all cities are connected. If not, return -1.

Time Complexity: O(ElogE) where E is the number of connections
Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of cities

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCost(int N, int[][] connections) {
        Arrays.sort(connections, (a, b) -> a[2] - b[2]);
        
        int[] parent = new int[N + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        
        int totalCost = 0;
        int numEdges = 0;
        
        for (int[] connection : connections) {
            int city1 = connection[0];
            int city2 = connection[1];
            int cost = connection[2];
            
            int parent1 = find(city1, parent);
            int parent2 = find(city2, parent);
            
            if (parent1 != parent2) {
                parent[parent1] = parent2;
                totalCost += cost;
                numEdges++;
            }
        }
        
        return numEdges == N - 1 ? totalCost : -1;
    }
    
    private int find(int city, int[] parent) {
        while (city != parent[city]) {
            parent[city] = parent[parent[city]];
            city = parent[city];
        }
        return city;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCost(int N, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        sort(connections.begin(), connections.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[2] < b[2];
        });
        
        vector<int> parent(N + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        
        int totalCost = 0;
        int numEdges = 0;
        
        for (auto& connection : connections) {
            int city1 = connection[0];
            int city2 = connection[1];
            int cost = connection[2];
            
            int parent1 = find(city1, parent);
            int parent2 = find(city2, parent);
            
            if (parent1 != parent2) {
                parent[parent1] = parent2;
                totalCost += cost;
                numEdges++;
            }
        }
        
        return numEdges == N - 1 ? totalCost : -1;
    }
    
    int find(int city, vector<int>& parent) {
        while (city != parent[city]) {
            parent[city] = parent[parent[city]];
            city = parent[city];
        }
        return city;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, N: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        connections.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
        
        parent = list(range(N + 1))
        
        totalCost = 0
        numEdges = 0
        
        def find(city, parent):
            while city != parent[city]:
                parent[city] = parent[parent[city]]
                city = parent[city]
            return city
        
        for connection in connections:
            city1, city2, cost = connection
            
            parent1 = find(city1, parent)
            parent2 = find(city2, parent)
            
            if parent1 != parent2:
                parent[parent1] = parent2
                totalCost += cost
                numEdges += 1
        
        return totalCost if numEdges == N - 1 else -1
