### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can model the courses and their dependencies as a directed graph. We need to find the minimum number of semesters required to take all the courses such that prerequisites are satisfied. This problem can be solved using a topological sort approach.

1. Create a directed graph where each course is a node and the prerequisites are edges between nodes.
2. Calculate the in-degree of each node representing the number of prerequisites for that course.
3. Initialize a queue with all the courses that have no prerequisites.
4. While the queue is not empty, remove a course from the queue, decrement the in-degree of its adjacent nodes, and add any new courses with no prerequisites to the queue.
5. Keep track of the number of semesters passed and the number of courses taken.
6. The final answer will be the number of semesters needed to complete all courses.

    public int minimumSemesters(int N, int[][] relations) {

        int[] inDegree = new int[N + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (int[] relation : relations) {
            int from = relation[0];
            int to = relation[1];
            
            graph[from].add(to);
            inDegree[to]++;
