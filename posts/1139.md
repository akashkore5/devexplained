### Explanation
We can solve this problem by iterating through each cell in the grid and considering it as the top-left corner of a square. We then expand the square in all directions (right, down, and diagonally) to find the largest square with all 1s on its border. We keep track of the maximum square size found so far.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `maxSize` to store the maximum square size found.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
3. For each cell, consider it as the top-left corner of a square.
4. Expand the square in all directions to find the largest possible square with all 1s on its border.
5. Update `maxSize` if a larger square is found.
6. Return `maxSize` as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3), where n is the size of the grid.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.

```java
class Solution {
    public int largest1BorderedSquare(int[][] grid) {
        int maxSize = 0;
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int size = 1;
                    while (i + size < rows && j + size < cols) {
                        boolean isValid = true;
                        for (int k = 0; k <= size; k++) {
                            if (grid[i + k][j] == 0 || grid[i][j + k] == 0 || grid[i + size][j + k] == 0 || grid[i + k][j + size] == 0) {
                                isValid = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                        if (isValid) {
                            maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, (size + 1) * (size + 1));
                        }
                        size++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return maxSize;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp

public:
    int largest1BorderedSquare(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int maxSize = 0;
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int size = 1;
                    while (i + size < rows && j + size < cols) {
                        bool isValid = true;
                        for (int k = 0; k <= size; k++) {
                            if (grid[i + k][j] == 0 || grid[i][j + k] == 0 || grid[i + size][j + k] == 0 || grid[i + k][j + size] == 0) {
                                isValid = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                        if (isValid) {
                            maxSize = max(maxSize, (size + 1) * (size + 1));
                        }
                        size++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return maxSize;
