## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to count the number of active users for each day within a 30-day period ending on a specific date. We can achieve this by grouping the activities by user and date, and then counting the distinct users for each date.

1. Filter the activities within the 30-day period ending on the target date.
2. Group the activities by activity_date and user_id.
3. Count the distinct user_ids for each activity_date.
4. Output the result for days with at least one active user.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Activity table.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the intermediate results.
