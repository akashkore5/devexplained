### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find all authors who have viewed at least one of their own articles. We can achieve this by joining the Views table with itself on `author_id = viewer_id` and `article_id = article_id`. This will give us the authors who viewed their own articles. Then, we select distinct author_id from this joined result.
