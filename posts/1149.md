## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can keep track of the total number of views each day and calculate the total number of views for the past 7 days at any given day. We can maintain a sliding window of size 7 and update the total views accordingly.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array `views` to store the total number of views each day.
2. Initialize a variable `totalViews` to store the total number of views for the past 7 days.
3. Initialize a deque `deque` to store the views for the past 7 days.
4. Iterate through the input `arr`:
   - Add the current day's views to `totalViews`.
   - Add the current day's views to the deque.
   - If the size of the deque exceeds 7, remove the oldest day's views from both `totalViews` and the deque.
   - Update the `views` array with the total views for the current day.
5. Return the `views` array.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] T) {
        int[] views = new int[T.length];
        int totalViews = 0;
        Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < T.length; i++) {
            totalViews += T[i];
            deque.add(T[i]);
            
            if (deque.size() > 7) {
                int oldestView = deque.poll();
                totalViews -= oldestView;
            }
            
            views[i] = totalViews;
        }
        
        return views;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& T) {
        vector<int> views(T.size());
        int totalViews = 0;
        deque<int> deque;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            totalViews += T[i];
            deque.push_back(T[i]);
            
            if (deque.size() > 7) {
                int oldestView = deque.front();
                deque.pop_front();
                totalViews -= oldestView;
            }
            
            views[i] = totalViews;
        }
        
        return views;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        views = [0] * len(T)
        total_views = 0
        deque = deque()
        
        for i in range(len(T)):
            total_views += T[i]
            deque.append(T[i])
            
            if len(deque) > 7:
                oldest_view = deque.popleft()
                total_views -= oldest_view
            
            views[i] = total_views
        
        return views
```
