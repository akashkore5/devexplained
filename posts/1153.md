### Explanation:

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, we need to determine if it is possible to transform `str1` into `str2` by performing the following operations:
1. Replace any character in `str1` with any other lowercase English alphabet character.
2. Transform `str1` into `str2`.

To solve this problem, we can use a mapping to keep track of the characters that have been replaced. We need to ensure that each character in `str1` maps to only one character in `str2`.

### Algorithmic Idea:

1. If the lengths of `str1` and `str2` are not equal, return `false`, as it is impossible to transform `str1` into `str2`.
2. Create a mapping to store the character replacements from `str1` to `str2`.
3. Iterate through each character in `str1` and `str2`.
4. If the character in `str1` is already mapped to a different character in `str2`, return `false`.
5. If the character in `str1` is not mapped yet, add it to the mapping.
6. After processing all characters, if the size of the mapping is less than 26 (the number of lowercase English alphabet characters), return `true`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings `str1` and `str2`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(26) = O(1) since the mapping can have at most 26 entries.

        Map<Character, Character> mapping = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++) {
            char c1 = str1.charAt(i);
            char c2 = str2.charAt(i);

                return false;
            }
