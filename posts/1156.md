### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and keep track of the longest substring with repeated characters that can be obtained by swapping two characters. We can use a sliding window approach to find the longest substring with repeated characters.

1. Initialize variables:
   - `maxLen` to store the maximum length of the repeated character substring.
   - `maxFreq` to store the maximum frequency of any character in the current window.
   - `count` to store the total count of characters in the current window.
   - `window` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
   - `start` to mark the start of the current window.

2. Iterate through the string:
   - For each character in the string:
     - Increment the frequency of the character in the window.
     - Update `maxFreq` with the maximum frequency encountered so far.
     - Update `count` with the total count of characters in the current window.
     - While the condition `count - maxFreq > k` is met:
       - Decrement the frequency of the character at index `start`.
       - Increment `start` to move the window.
     - Update `maxLen` with the maximum of `maxLen` and `count`.

3. Return the `maxLen`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int[] window = new int[26];
        int maxLen = 0, maxFreq = 0, start = 0, count = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, ++window[s.charAt(end) - 'A']);
            count++;

            while (count - maxFreq > k) {
                window[s.charAt(start) - 'A']--;
                start++;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, count);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> window(26, 0);
        int maxLen = 0, maxFreq = 0, start = 0, count = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, ++window[s[end] - 'A']);
            count++;

            while (count - maxFreq > k) {
                window[s[start] - 'A']--;
                start++;
            }

            maxLen = max(maxLen, count);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        window = [0] * 26
        maxLen = 0
        maxFreq = 0
        start = 0
        count = 0

        for end in range(len(s)):
            window[ord(s[end]) - ord('A')] += 1
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, window[ord(s[end]) - ord('A')])
            count += 1

            while count - maxFreq > k:
                window[ord(s[start]) - ord('A')] -= 1
                start += 1

            maxLen = max(maxLen, count)

        return maxLen
```
