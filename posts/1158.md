### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to join the `Users` and `Orders` tables based on the `buyer_id` column. We can then filter the orders made in 2019 and count them for each user. Finally, we need to return the `user_id`, `join_date`, and the number of orders made in 2019 for each user.

1. Perform a left join on `Users` and `Orders` tables based on the `buyer_id`.
2. Filter the orders made in 2019.
3. Group the results by `buyer_id`.
4. Count the number of orders for each user.
5. Return the `user_id`, `join_date`, and the count of orders made in 2019.

FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2019-01-01' AND o.order_date <= '2019-12-31' OR o.order_id IS NULL
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.join_date
