### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can utilize a level order traversal approach with constant extra space. We can use the `next` pointers already present in the nodes to connect the nodes at the same level.

1. We start from the root and keep moving level by level.
2. For each level, we iterate through the nodes at that level and connect their children using the `next` pointers.
3. The next pointers at each level are already set correctly for the previous level, so we can utilize this to connect the nodes at the current level.
4. We continue this process until we reach the last level of the tree.

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using constant extra space.```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Node levelStart = root;
        
        while (levelStart.left != null) {
            Node curr = levelStart;
            
            while (curr != null) {
                curr.left.next = curr.right;
                if (curr.next != null) {
                    curr.right.next = curr.next.left;
                }
                
                curr = curr.next;
            }
            
            levelStart = levelStart.left;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        Node* levelStart = root;
        
        while (levelStart->left != nullptr) {
            Node* curr = levelStart;
            
            while (curr != nullptr) {
                curr->left->next = curr->right;
                if (curr->next != nullptr) {
                    curr->right->next = curr->next->left;
                }
                
                curr = curr->next;
            }
            
            levelStart = levelStart->left;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        level_start = root
        
        while level_start.left:
            curr = level_start
            
            while curr:
                curr.left.next = curr.right
                if curr.next:
                    curr.right.next = curr.next.left
                
                curr = curr.next
            
            level_start = level_start.left
        
        return root
