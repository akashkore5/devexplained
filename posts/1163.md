## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We start with two pointers at the beginning of the string. We compare the characters at the positions pointed by the two pointers. The pointer pointing to the character with a greater value will be moved to the next position. If the characters are equal, we need to continue comparing the characters at the subsequent positions until we find a character that is larger.

By following this approach, we will eventually find the lexicographically maximum substring in the string.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public String lastSubstring(String s) {
        int i = 0, j = 1, k = 0;
        int len = s.length();
        
        while (j + k < len) {
            if (s.charAt(i + k) == s.charAt(j + k)) {
                k++;
                continue;
            }
            
            if (s.charAt(i + k) < s.charAt(j + k)) {
                i = j;
            }
            
            j += k + 1;
            k = 0;
        }
        
        return s.substring(i);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string lastSubstring(string s) {
        int i = 0, j = 1, k = 0;
        int len = s.length();
        
        while (j + k < len) {
            if (s[i + k] == s[j + k]) {
                k++;
                continue;
            }
            
            if (s[i + k] < s[j + k]) {
                i = j;
            }
            
            j += k + 1;
            k = 0;
        }
        
        return s.substr(i);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def lastSubstring(self, s: str) -> str:
        i, j, k = 0, 1, 0
        length = len(s)
        
        while j + k < length:
            if s[i + k] == s[j + k]:
                k += 1
                continue
            
            if s[i + k] < s[j + k]:
                i = j
            
            j += k + 1
            k = 0
            
        return s[i:]
```
