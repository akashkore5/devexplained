### Explanation:
To find the prices of all products on a given date (2019-08-16), we can approach the problem by considering the following steps:
1. Initialize the price of all products as 10 (before any change).
2. Query the Products table to get the latest price change for each product before or on the given date.
3. If a product has a price change on the given date, consider the new price; otherwise, use the latest price change before the given date.
4. Return the result table with product_id and the corresponding price on the given date.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a HashMap to store the latest price change for each product.
2. Iterate through the Products table and update the HashMap with the latest price change for each product.
3. If a product has a price change on the given date, update the price in the HashMap; otherwise, keep the latest price change before the given date.
4. Return the result table with product_id and the corresponding price on the given date.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Products table.
Space Complexity: O(n), for the HashMap storing the latest price change for each product.
