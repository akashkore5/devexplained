### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the time taken to type a given string using a single-row keyboard. The keyboard layout is given as a string of unique characters representing the keys in order. We iterate through the given word and calculate the time taken to type each character based on its position in the keyboard layout. 

1. Create a hashmap to store the index of each character in the keyboard layout.
2. Initialize the total time taken to type as 0.
3. Iterate through the characters in the given word.
4. Calculate the time taken to type each character based on the absolute difference in indices between the current character and the previous character.
5. Add this time to the total time taken.
6. Return the total time taken to type the entire word.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateTime(String keyboard, String word) {
        Map<Character, Integer> keyboardMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < keyboard.length(); i++) {
            keyboardMap.put(keyboard.charAt(i), i);
        }
        
        int totalTime = 0;
        int prevIndex = 0;
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            int currentIndex = keyboardMap.get(c);
            totalTime += Math.abs(currentIndex - prevIndex);
            prevIndex = currentIndex;
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int calculateTime(string keyboard, string word) {
        unordered_map<char, int> keyboardMap;
        for (int i = 0; i < keyboard.size(); i++) {
            keyboardMap[keyboard[i]] = i;
        }
        
        int totalTime = 0;
        int prevIndex = 0;
        for (char c : word) {
            int currentIndex = keyboardMap[c];
            totalTime += abs(currentIndex - prevIndex);
            prevIndex = currentIndex;
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def calculateTime(self, keyboard: str, word: str) -> int:
        keyboard_map = {char: index for index, char in enumerate(keyboard)}
        
        total_time = 0
        prev_index = 0
        for c in word:
            current_index = keyboard_map[c]
            total_time += abs(current_index - prev_index)
            prev_index = current_index
        
        return total_time
```
