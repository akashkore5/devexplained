### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the current smallest sticks. At each step, we can pop the two smallest sticks from the priority queue, combine them, and add the cost of the combined stick back to the priority queue. We repeat this process until there is only one stick left in the priority queue, which will be the minimum cost to connect all the sticks.

1. Initialize a priority queue (min heap) with all the given sticks.
2. While the priority queue has more than one stick:
    - Pop the two smallest sticks from the priority queue.
    - Combine the two sticks and calculate the cost.
    - Add the cost of the combined stick back to the priority queue.
3. The remaining stick in the priority queue will be the minimum cost to connect all sticks.
:
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int connectSticks(int[] sticks) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int stick : sticks) {
            pq.offer(stick);
        }
        
        int cost = 0;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int stick1 = pq.poll();
            int stick2 = pq.poll();
            int combinedStick = stick1 + stick2;
            cost += combinedStick;
            pq.offer(combinedStick);
        }
        
        return cost;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int connectSticks(vector<int>& sticks) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        
        int cost = 0;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int stick1 = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int stick2 = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int combinedStick = stick1 + stick2;
            cost += combinedStick;
            pq.push(combinedStick);
        }
        
        return cost;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def connectSticks(self, sticks: List[int]) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(sticks)
        
        cost = 0
        while len(sticks) > 1:
            stick1 = heapq.heappop(sticks)
            stick2 = heapq.heappop(sticks)
            combinedStick = stick1 + stick2
            cost += combinedStick
            heapq.heappush(sticks, combinedStick)
        
        return cost
```
