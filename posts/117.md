### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can perform a level order traversal of the binary tree and connect the nodes at each level using the `next` pointer. We can use a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level and connect them accordingly.

1. Start with the root node.
2. Initialize a queue and add the root node to it.
3. While the queue is not empty, iterate through the nodes at the current level and connect them using the `next` pointer.
4. Add the children nodes of the current level to the queue for processing in the next iteration.
5. Repeat the process until all levels are processed.

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

**Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case where all nodes are at the same level.```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Node current = queue.poll();
                
                if (i < size - 1) {
                    current.next = queue.peek();
                }
                
                if (current.left != null) queue.offer(current.left);
                if (current.right != null) queue.offer(current.right);
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;
        
        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Node* current = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                if (i < size - 1) {
                    current->next = q.front();
                }
                
                if (current->left != nullptr) q.push(current->left);
                if (current->right != nullptr) q.push(current->right);
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        queue = deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            size = len(queue)
            
            for i in range(size):
                current = queue.popleft()
                
                if i < size - 1:
                    current.next = queue[0]
                
                if current.left:
                    queue.append(current.left)
                if current.right:
                    queue.append(current.right)
        
        return root
```
