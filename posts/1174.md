### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers. We can achieve this by first identifying the first order of each customer and then checking if it is an immediate order or not. Finally, we calculate the percentage of immediate first orders.

1. Group the delivery records by `customer_id`.
2. For each group, find the order with the earliest `order_date` as the first order.
3. Check if the `customer_pref_delivery_date` of the first order is the same as the `order_date` (immediate order) or not.
4. Calculate the percentage of immediate first orders.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT ROUND(
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
    FROM Delivery 
    WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM Delivery ORDER BY order_date LIMIT 1) 
    AND order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery;
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT ROUND(
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
    FROM Delivery 
    WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM Delivery ORDER BY order_date LIMIT 1) 
    AND order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery;
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT ROUND(
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
    FROM Delivery 
    WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM Delivery ORDER BY order_date LIMIT 1) 
    AND order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery;
```
