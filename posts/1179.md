## Explanation
To reformat the department table, we need to pivot the data such that each month's revenue becomes a separate column in the output table. We can achieve this by using a SQL query with a `CASE` statement for each month to extract the revenue for that specific month. The `CASE` statement will populate the corresponding column with revenue if it matches the month, else it will be `NULL`.
### SQL
```sql
SELECT id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Apr' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Apr_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'May' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS May_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jun' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Jun_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jul' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Jul_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Aug' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Aug_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Sep' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Sep_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Oct' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Nov' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id;
