### Explanation

Given a string `S`, we need to count the number of substrings with only one distinct letter.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string `S` and count the number of consecutive characters that are the same. For each group of consecutive characters, we can calculate the number of substrings with only one distinct letter that can be formed using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the length of the group.```java
class Solution {
    public int countLetters(String S) {
        int count = 0;
        int consecutive = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < S.length(); i++) {
            if (S.charAt(i) == S.charAt(i - 1)) {
                consecutive++;
            } else {
                count += (consecutive * (consecutive + 1)) / 2; // Calculate number of substrings
                consecutive = 1;
            }
        }
        
        count += (consecutive * (consecutive + 1)) / 2; // Calculate for the last group
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countLetters(string S) {
        int count = 0;
        int consecutive = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < S.length(); i++) {
            if (S[i] == S[i - 1]) {
                consecutive++;
            } else {
                count += (consecutive * (consecutive + 1)) / 2; // Calculate number of substrings
                consecutive = 1;
            }
        }
        
        count += (consecutive * (consecutive + 1)) / 2; // Calculate for the last group
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def countLetters(self, S: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        consecutive = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(S)):
            if S[i] == S[i - 1]:
                consecutive += 1
            else:
                count += (consecutive * (consecutive + 1)) // 2  # Calculate number of substrings
                consecutive = 1
        
        count += (consecutive * (consecutive + 1)) // 2  # Calculate for the last group
        
        return count
```
