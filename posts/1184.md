## Explanation

To find the shortest distance between two bus stops on a circular route, we can calculate the total distance between all stops either clockwise or counterclockwise, and then calculate the minimum distance between the given start and destination stops by taking the minimum of the two possible distances.

1. Calculate the total distance in clockwise direction starting from `start` to `destination`.
2. Calculate the total distance in counterclockwise direction starting from `start` to `destination`.
3. Return the minimum of the two distances calculated above.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of stops
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int distanceBetweenBusStops(int[] distance, int start, int destination) {
        if (start > destination) {
            int temp = start;
            start = destination;
            destination = temp;
        }
        
        int totalDistance = 0;
        int clockwiseDistance = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < distance.length; i++) {
            totalDistance += distance[i];
            if (i >= start && i < destination) {
                clockwiseDistance += distance[i];
            }
        }
        
        int counterclockwiseDistance = totalDistance - clockwiseDistance;
        
        return Math.min(clockwiseDistance, counterclockwiseDistance);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination) {
        if (start > destination) {
            swap(start, destination);
        }
        
        int totalDistance = 0;
        int clockwiseDistance = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < distance.size(); i++) {
            totalDistance += distance[i];
            if (i >= start && i < destination) {
                clockwiseDistance += distance[i];
            }
        }
        
        int counterclockwiseDistance = totalDistance - clockwiseDistance;
        
        return min(clockwiseDistance, counterclockwiseDistance);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        if start > destination:
            start, destination = destination, start
        
        total_distance = sum(distance)
        clockwise_distance = sum(distance[start:destination])
        counterclockwise_distance = total_distance - clockwise_distance
        
        return min(clockwise_distance, counterclockwise_distance)
