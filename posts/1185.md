### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use Zeller's Congruence algorithm to calculate the day of the week for a given date. The algorithm involves a formula that takes into account the day, month, and year of the date and returns a number corresponding to the day of the week. We can then map this number to the actual day name.

### Algorithm
1. Adjust the month and year for Zeller's Congruence formula:
   - If the month is January or February, treat them as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
   - Adjust the year accordingly.

2. Apply Zeller's Congruence formula:
   - Calculate the day of the week using the formula:
     \[
     h = (q + \left\lfloor \frac{13(m+1)}{5} \right\rfloor + K + \left\lfloor \frac{K}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{J}{4} \right\rfloor - 2J) \mod 7
     \]
     where:
     - \( h \) is the day of the week (0 for Saturday, 1 for Sunday, ..., 6 for Friday)
     - \( q \) is the day of the month
     - \( m \) is the adjusted month
     - \( K \) is the year of the century (year % 100)
     - \( J \) is the zero-based century (year / 100)

3. Map the calculated day of the week value to the corresponding day name.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public String dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        String[] daysOfWeek = {"Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};
        
        if (month < 3) {
            month += 12;
            year--;
        }
        
        int q = day;
        int m = month;
        int K = year % 100;
        int J = year / 100;
        
        int h = (q + (13 * (m + 1) / 5) + K + (K / 4) + (J / 4) - 2 * J) % 7;
        
        return daysOfWeek[(h + 5) % 7]; // Adjust for Zeller's Congruence result
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        vector<string> daysOfWeek = {"Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};
        
        if (month < 3) {
            month += 12;
            year--;
        }
        
        int q = day;
        int m = month;
        int K = year % 100;
        int J = year / 100;
        
        int h = (q + (13 * (m + 1) / 5) + K + (K / 4) + (J / 4) - 2 * J) % 7;
        
        return daysOfWeek[(h + 5) % 7]; // Adjust for Zeller's Congruence result
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def dayOfTheWeek(self, day: int, month: int, year: int) -> str:
        days_of_week = ["Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
        
        if month < 3:
            month += 12
            year -= 1
        
        q = day
        m = month
        K = year % 100
        J = year // 100
        
        h = (q + (13 * (m + 1) // 5) + K + (K // 4) + (J // 4) - 2 * J) % 7
        
        return days_of_week[(h + 5) % 7] # Adjust for Zeller's Congruence result
