## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum with and without deletion at each index of the array. We can then iterate through the array and update the maximum sum accordingly. At each index, we have two choices:
1. Continue the subarray by adding the current element to the sum.
2. Start a new subarray with the current element (deleting the previous element or not).

We will maintain two arrays to keep track of these two cases. At each index, we update these arrays and calculate the maximum sum by considering both cases.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize two arrays `dp_keep` and `dp_delete` of size `arr.length` to keep track of the maximum sum with and without deletion at each index.
2. Initialize `maxSum` to the first element of the array.
3. Iterate through the array from the second element:
   - Update `dp_keep[i]` and `dp_delete[i]` based on the maximum of the following:
     - `dp_keep[i-1] + arr[i]` (continuing the subarray)
     - `arr[i]` (starting a new subarray with the current element)
     - `dp_delete[i-1] + arr[i]` (starting a new subarray by deleting the previous element)
   - Update `maxSum` by considering the maximum of `maxSum`, `dp_keep[i]`, and `dp_delete[i]`.
4. Return `maxSum`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the size of the input array `arr`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) as we are using two arrays of size n to store the dynamic programming values.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumSum(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] dp_keep = new int[n];
        int[] dp_delete = new int[n];
        int maxSum = arr[0];
        
        dp_keep[0] = arr[0];
        dp_delete[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp_keep[i] = Math.max(dp_keep[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
            dp_delete[i] = Math.max(dp_keep[i-1], dp_delete[i-1] + arr[i]);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, Math.max(dp_keep[i], dp_delete[i]));
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumSum(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> dp_keep(n);
        vector<int> dp_delete(n);
        int maxSum = arr[0];
        
        dp_keep[0] = arr[0];
        dp_delete[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp_keep[i] = max(dp_keep[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
            dp_delete[i] = max(dp_keep[i-1], dp_delete[i-1] + arr[i]);
            maxSum = max(maxSum, max(dp_keep[i], dp_delete[i]));
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumSum(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        dp_keep = [0] * n
        dp_delete = [0] * n
        maxSum = arr[0]
        
        dp_keep[0] = arr[0]
        dp_delete[0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp_keep[i] = max(dp_keep[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i])
            dp_delete[i] = max(dp_keep[i-1], dp_delete[i-1] + arr[i])
            maxSum = max(maxSum, max(dp_keep[i], dp_delete[i]))
        
        return maxSum
```
