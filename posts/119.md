### Explanation

To generate the rowIndex-th row of Pascal's Triangle, we can use the property that each element in the triangle is the sum of the two elements directly above it. We can start with the first row [1], then iteratively compute the next row based on the previous row.

We can optimize the space complexity to O(rowIndex) by only storing the current row and updating it in place without needing to store the entire triangle.

- Time complexity: O(rowIndex^2) - we need to compute each element in each row up to rowIndex
- Space complexity: O(rowIndex) - only storing the current row```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            row.add(0, 1); // Add 1 at the beginning of the row
            for (int j = 1; j < row.size() - 1; j++) {
                row.set(j, row.get(j) + row.get(j + 1)); // Update each element based on the previous row
            }
        }
        return row;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        vector<int> row(rowIndex + 1, 0);
        row[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j > 0; j--) {
                row[j] += row[j - 1];
            }
        }
        return row;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def getRow(self, rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:
        row = [0] * (rowIndex + 1)
        row[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, rowIndex + 1):
            for j in range(i, 0, -1):
                row[j] += row[j - 1]
        return row
```
