### Explanation

To find critical connections in a network, we can use Tarjan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a graph. In this problem, we treat each server as a node in the graph and each connection as an edge. We can then identify the critical connections by finding the bridges in the graph.

The idea is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each node in the graph and keep track of the discovery time of each node and the lowest reachable node from that node. If the lowest reachable node from a node is greater than the discovery time of the current node, then the edge connecting them is a critical connection.

By using Tarjan's algorithm, we can efficiently find all critical connections in the network.

- Time complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (servers) and E is the number of edges (connections).
- Space complexity: O(V + E) for storing the graph and the data structures used in Tarjan's algorithm.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (List<Integer> connection : connections) {
            int from = connection.get(0);
            int to = connection.get(1);
            graph[from].add(to);
            graph[to].add(from);
        }
        
        int[] discovery = new int[n];
        int[] low = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(discovery, -1);
