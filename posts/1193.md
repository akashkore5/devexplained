## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to group the transactions by month and country. Then, for each group, we need to calculate the total number of transactions, total amount, number of approved transactions, and total amount of approved transactions.

We can achieve this by using the SQL GROUP BY clause along with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and CASE WHEN.

The steps to solve the problem are as follows:
1. Group the transactions by month and country.
2. Count the total number of transactions and their total amount for each group.
3. Count the number of approved transactions and their total amount for each group.
4. Use CASE WHEN to differentiate between approved and declined transactions.
5. Return the result table with the required columns.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Transactions table. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result set.

```java

String sql = "SELECT DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, country, " +
             "COUNT(*) AS trans_count, " +
             "SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, " +
             "SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count, " +
             "SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount " +
             "FROM Transactions " +
             "GROUP BY month, country";
```

```cpp
// Write your C++ solution here
string sql = "SELECT DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, country, " \
             "COUNT(*) AS trans_count, " \
             "SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, " \
             "SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count, " \
             "SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount " \
             "FROM Transactions " \
             "GROUP BY month, country";
```

```python
