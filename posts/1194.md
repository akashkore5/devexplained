## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a tournament where the matches are represented as a list of results. Each match consists of two teams competing against each other, and the winner advances to the next round. The input is a list of match results in the form of [winner, loser]. The task is to find the winner of the tournament.

We can use a stack to keep track of the current winners in each round. We iterate through the matches, pushing the winner onto the stack. If there are two winners on the stack, we pair them up and determine the winner of that round. We continue this process until we have a single winner left on the stack.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String tournamentWinner(List<List<String>> competitions, List<Integer> results) {
        Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();
        String currentBestTeam = "";
        int maxScore = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < competitions.size(); i++) {
            List<String> match = competitions.get(i);
            String winner = results.get(i) == 1 ? match.get(0) : match.get(1);

            scores.put(winner, scores.getOrDefault(winner, 0) + 3);

            if (scores.get(winner) > maxScore) {
                maxScore = scores.get(winner);
                currentBestTeam = winner;
            }
        }

        return currentBestTeam;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string tournamentWinner(std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>& competitions, std::vector<int>& results) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> scores;
        std::string currentBestTeam = "";
        int maxScore = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < competitions.size(); i++) {
            std::vector<std::string> match = competitions[i];
            std::string winner = results[i] == 1 ? match[0] : match[1];

            scores[winner] += 3;

            if (scores[winner] > maxScore) {
                maxScore = scores[winner];
                currentBestTeam = winner;
            }
        }

        return currentBestTeam;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def tournamentWinner(self, competitions: List[List[str]], results: List[int]) -> str:
        scores = {}
        current_best_team = ""
        max_score = 0

        for i in range(len(competitions)):
            match = competitions[i]
            winner = match[0] if results[i] == 1 else match[1]

            scores[winner] = scores.get(winner, 0) + 3

            if scores[winner] > max_score:
                max_score = scores[winner]
                current_best_team = winner

        return current_best_team
```
