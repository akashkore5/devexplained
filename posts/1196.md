### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of apples that can be put into a basket given the weight capacity of the basket. We are given an array where each element represents the weight of an apple. The basket can only carry a maximum weight of `maxWeight` and we can only put apples into the basket that weigh less than or equal to the `maxWeight`.

We can use a greedy approach to solve this problem. We will sort the array of apple weights in non-decreasing order. Then, we will start putting apples into the basket one by one until we reach the maximum weight capacity. If adding the next apple exceeds the maximum weight, we stop and return the count of apples added.
:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfApples(int[] arr, int maxWeight) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int count = 0;
        int totalWeight = 0;
        for (int weight : arr) {
            if (totalWeight + weight <= maxWeight) {
                count++;
                totalWeight += weight;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfApples(std::vector<int>& arr, int maxWeight) {
        std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int count = 0;
        int totalWeight = 0;
        for (int weight : arr) {
            if (totalWeight + weight <= maxWeight) {
                count++;
                totalWeight += weight;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfApples(self, arr: List[int], maxWeight: int) -> int:
        arr.sort()
        count = 0
        total_weight = 0
        for weight in arr:
            if total_weight + weight <= maxWeight:
                count += 1
                total_weight += weight
            else:
                break
        return count
```
