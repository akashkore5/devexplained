### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a topological sort within groups and across groups. First, we need to construct the directed graph based on the dependencies provided. Then, we can perform a topological sort within each group to determine the order of items within each group. After that, we can perform a topological sort across groups based on the group dependencies.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Create a directed graph using adjacency lists to represent the dependencies between items.
2. Create a group graph to represent the dependencies between groups.
3. Perform a topological sort within each group to determine the order of items within each group. Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting.
4. Perform a topological sort across groups based on the group dependencies.
5. Return the sorted list of items if a valid solution exists.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n + m) where n is the number of items and m is the number of groups.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n + m) for storing the graphs.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortItems(int n, int m, int[] group, List<List<Integer>> beforeItems) {
        // Java solution
        // Implementation in progress
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortItems(int n, int m, vector<int>& group, vector<vector<int>>& beforeItems) {
        // C++ solution
        // Implementation in progress
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def sortItems(self, n: int, m: int, group: List[int], beforeItems: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Python solution
        # Implementation in progress
```
