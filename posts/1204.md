## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the queue of people in the order of their turn and keep track of the total weight of people boarding the bus. We will stop iterating when the total weight exceeds the limit of 1000 kilograms. The last person who can fit on the bus will be the person before the total weight exceeds the limit.

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort the queue of people based on their turn in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted queue and keep track of the total weight.
3. Stop iterating when the total weight exceeds 1000 kilograms.
4. Return the name of the person before the weight limit is exceeded.

**Time Complexity:** O(nlogn) - Sorting the queue with n people
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant extra space is used
