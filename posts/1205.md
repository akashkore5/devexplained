### Explanation:

Given a list of transactions where each transaction contains information such as id, month, amount, and city, we need to find the city with the highest total amount spent by customers.

To solve this problem, we can use a HashMap to store the total amount spent by customers in each city. We iterate through the transactions, updating the total amount for each city. Finally, we find the city with the highest total amount spent.

#### Algorithm:
1. Create a HashMap to store the total amount spent by customers in each city.
2. Iterate through the transactions:
   - If the city is not present in the HashMap, add it with the amount as the value.
   - If the city is already present, update the total amount by adding the current amount.
3. Find the city with the highest total amount spent.
4. Return the city with the highest total amount spent.

#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of transactions.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also O(n) to store the total amount spent in each city.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String highestSpender(String[][] transactions) {
        Map<String, Integer> cityAmount = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String[] transaction : transactions) {
            String city = transaction[3];
            int amount = Integer.parseInt(transaction[2]);
            
            cityAmount.put(city, cityAmount.getOrDefault(city, 0) + amount);
        }
        
        String highestSpender = "";
        int maxAmount = 0;
        
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : cityAmount.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > maxAmount) {
                maxAmount = entry.getValue();
                highestSpender = entry.getKey();
            }
        }
        
        return highestSpender;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string highestSpender(vector<vector<string>>& transactions) {
        unordered_map<string, int> cityAmount;
        
        for (auto transaction : transactions) {
            string city = transaction[3];
            int amount = stoi(transaction[2]);
            
            cityAmount[city] += amount;
        }
        
        string highestSpender = "";
        int maxAmount = 0;
        
        for (auto entry : cityAmount) {
            if (entry.second > maxAmount) {
                maxAmount = entry.second;
                highestSpender = entry.first;
            }
        }
        
        return highestSpender;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def highestSpender(self, transactions: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        city_amount = {}
        
        for transaction in transactions:
            city = transaction[3]
            amount = int(transaction[2])
            
            city_amount[city] = city_amount.get(city, 0) + amount
        
        highest_spender = ""
        max_amount = 0
        
        for city, total_amount in city_amount.items():
            if total_amount > max_amount:
                max_amount = total_amount
                highest_spender = city
        
        return highest_spender
