## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window that represents the substring of `s` that we are considering. We will keep track of the cost of changing each character within the window and slide the window to the right while keeping the total cost within the given `maxCost`.

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize variables: `start` and `end` to represent the window, `currCost` to track the current cost within the window, and `maxLength` to store the length of the maximum substring.
2. Iterate over the characters of `s` using the sliding window approach:
   - Update `currCost` by adding the cost of changing the character at `end`.
   - If `currCost` exceeds `maxCost`, move the `start` of the window to the right and subtract the cost of changing the character at `start` from `currCost`.
   - Update `maxLength` with the maximum length of the substring with cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.
3. Return `maxLength`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int start = 0, end = 0, currCost = 0, maxLength = 0;
        
        for (; end < s.length(); end++) {
            currCost += Math.abs(s.charAt(end) - t.charAt(end));
            
            while (currCost > maxCost) {
                currCost -= Math.abs(s.charAt(start) - t.charAt(start));
                start++;
            }
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        int start = 0, end = 0, currCost = 0, maxLength = 0;
        
        for (; end < s.length(); end++) {
            currCost += abs(s[end] - t[end]);
            
            while (currCost > maxCost) {
                currCost -= abs(s[start] - t[start]);
                start++;
            }
            
            maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:
        start = 0
        currCost = 0
        maxLength = 0

        for end in range(len(s)):
            currCost += abs(ord(s[end]) - ord(t[end]))

            while currCost > maxCost:
                currCost -= abs(ord(s[start]) - ord(t[start])
                start += 1

            maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1)

        return maxLength
```
