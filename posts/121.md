### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach of iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling at the current price. We update the maximum profit whenever we find a new peak price that gives a better profit.

- Start with the first element of the array as the minimum price and the maximum profit as 0.
- Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
  - Update the minimum price seen so far.
  - Calculate the profit that can be achieved by selling at the current price.
  - Update the maximum profit if the current profit is greater.
- Return the maximum profit as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minPrice = INT_MAX;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            minPrice = min(minPrice, price);
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        minPrice = float('inf')
        maxProfit = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            minPrice = min(minPrice, price)
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - minPrice)
        
        return maxProfit
```
