### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the quality and poor query percentage for each distinct query name based on the given formulas. We can achieve this by grouping the data by query name, calculating the required values, and then formatting the output accordingly.

1. Initialize a temporary table to store the sum of ratings divided by positions and the count of poor queries for each query name.
2. Calculate the quality for each query by summing up the ratio of rating to position for each row and then dividing by the total count of rows for that query.
3. Calculate the poor query percentage for each query by counting the number of rows with a rating less than 3 and dividing by the total count of rows for that query.
4. Round the quality and poor query percentage to 2 decimal places.
5. Return the query name, quality, and poor query percentage in the desired output format.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of rows in the input table.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the temporary table data.

```java

SELECT query_name, 
ROUND(SUM(CAST(rating AS DECIMAL) / position) / COUNT(*), 2) AS quality,
ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name;
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT query_name, 
ROUND(SUM(CAST(rating AS DECIMAL) / position) / COUNT(*), 2) AS quality,
ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name;
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT query_name, 
ROUND(SUM(CAST(rating AS DECIMAL) / position) / COUNT(*), 2) AS quality,
ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name;
