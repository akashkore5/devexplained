## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make a given string a palindrome. We can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of characters that need to be removed to make the substring from i to j a palindrome. We can then use this information to build a dynamic programming table to store the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make all substrings from i to j a palindrome.

The algorithmic idea involves iterating through the string and filling up the dynamic programming table based on whether the characters at the current indices match or not. We update the table based on three cases:
1. If the characters at the current indices match, we can ignore them and move to the next indices.
2. If the characters at the current indices do not match, we have two options:
    a. We can remove the character at index i and continue with index j.
    b. We can remove the character at index j and continue with index i.
3. We choose the minimum of the two options above as the number of characters to be removed.

Finally, we check if the number of characters to be removed is less than or equal to the given k. If it is, then the string can be converted into a palindrome by removing at most k characters.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(n^2)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidPalindrome(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n-1] <= k;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidPalindrome(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n));
        
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n-1] <= k;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidPalindrome(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for length in range(2, n+1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        
        return dp[0][n-1] <= k
