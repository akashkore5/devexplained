### Explanation:
To minimize the cost of moving all chips to the same position, we need to consider the parity of the chips' positions. Since moving a chip by 2 units incurs no cost, we can group the chips based on whether they are at even or odd positions. Calculating the number of chips at even and odd positions, we can determine the minimum cost by finding the smaller group size.

### Algorithm:
1. Count the number of chips at even and odd positions.
2. Return the minimum of the two counts as the minimum cost.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of chips.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostToMoveChips(int[] position) {
        int evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;
        
        for (int chip : position) {
            if (chip % 2 == 0) {
                evenCount++;
            } else {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return Math.min(evenCount, oddCount);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostToMoveChips(vector<int>& position) {
        int evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;
        
        for (int chip : position) {
            if (chip % 2 == 0) {
                evenCount++;
            } else {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return min(evenCount, oddCount);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: List[int]) -> int:
        even_count = 0
        odd_count = 0
        
        for chip in position:
            if chip % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
        
        return min(even_count, odd_count)
