### Explanation:
- **Algorithmic Idea:**
  - We can solve this problem using dynamic programming.
  - We will maintain a hashmap where the key is the current element `arr[i]` and the value is the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at `arr[i]`.
  - For each element `arr[i]`, we check if `arr[i] - difference` is present in the hashmap. If it is present, we update the length of the current subsequence as `dp[arr[i]] = dp[arr[i] - difference] + 1`.
  - Finally, we find the maximum length of the subsequence in the hashmap.

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> dp = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 1;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            dp.put(num, dp.getOrDefault(num - difference, 0) + 1);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp.get(num));
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(std::vector<int>& arr, int difference) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        int maxLength = 1;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            dp[num] = dp[num - difference] + 1;
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, dp[num]);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, arr: List[int], difference: int) -> int:
        dp = {}
        maxLength = 1
        
        for num in arr:
            dp[num] = dp.get(num - difference, 0) + 1
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[num])
        
        return maxLength
```
