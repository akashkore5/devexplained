### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths starting from each cell with gold. At each step, we can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and collect the gold in the current cell. We need to keep track of visited cells and avoid revisiting them.

- Initialize a variable `maxGold` to store the maximum gold collected.
- Iterate through each cell in the grid:
  - If the cell contains gold, start DFS from that cell.
- In the DFS function:
  - Update the `maxGold` if the current path's gold is greater.
  - Explore the four directions, if valid, and recursively call the DFS function.
- The DFS function should return the total gold collected in that path.
- Return `maxGold` as the final result.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(m*n*4^(m*n)) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(m*n) for the recursion stack and visited cells.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMaximumGold(int[][] grid) {
        int maxGold = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, dfs(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return maxGold;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int gold = grid[i][j];
        grid[i][j] = 0; // mark as visited
        
        int maxGold = 0;
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, gold + dfs(grid, i + 1, j));
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, gold + dfs(grid, i - 1, j));
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, gold + dfs(grid, i, j + 1));
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, gold + dfs(grid, i, j - 1));
