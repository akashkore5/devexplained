## Explanation

To find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling stocks, we can iterate through the prices array and whenever there is a price increase from the previous day, we can add that increase to the total profit. This is because we are allowed to buy and sell multiple times.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize `totalProfit` to 0.
2. Iterate through the prices array starting from index 1:
   - If the price on the current day is higher than the price on the previous day, add the difference to `totalProfit`.
3. Return `totalProfit`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the prices array.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int totalProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                totalProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return totalProfit;
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int totalProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                totalProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return totalProfit;
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        totalProfit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
                totalProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        return totalProfit
```
