### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` represent the probability that the `i-th` person gets their own seat. We can calculate the probability for each person by considering the scenarios where the first person takes either their own seat or someone else's seat.

- If the first person takes their own seat (with probability 1/n), then the `n-th` person will definitely get their own seat.
- If the first person takes another seat (with probability 1/n), then the `n-th` person has a probability of `dp[n-1]` of getting their own seat.

Therefore, the general formula for calculating `dp[i]` is: `dp[i] = 1/i + (i-1)/i * dp[i-1]`.

```java
class Solution {
    public double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1.0;
        }
        
        double[] dp = new double[n+1];
        dp[1] = 1.0;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1.0 / i + (i - 1.0) / i * dp[i - 1];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1.0;
        }
        
        vector<double> dp(n+1, 0.0);
        dp[1] = 1.0;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1.0 / i + (i - 1.0) / i * dp[i - 1];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def nthPersonGetsNthSeat(self, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 1:
            return 1.0
        
        dp = [0.0] * (n+1)
        dp[1] = 1.0
        
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = 1.0 / i + (i - 1.0) / i * dp[i - 1]
        
        return dp[n]
