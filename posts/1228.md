## Explanation:

To find the missing number in an arithmetic progression, we can calculate the common difference between the elements and then identify the missing number based on the expected progression. We can do this by calculating the actual common difference between the first two elements and comparing it with the expected common difference. Once we have the common difference, we can find the missing number by iterating through the elements and checking for any gaps in the progression.

Algorithm:
1. Calculate the common difference between the first two elements.
2. Calculate the expected common difference based on the total number of elements.
3. Iterate through the elements to find the missing number based on the expected progression.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int commonDiff = (arr[n-1] - arr[0]) / n;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[i-1] + commonDiff) {
                return arr[i-1] + commonDiff;
            }
        }
        
        return arr[0];
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int commonDiff = (arr[n-1] - arr[0]) / n;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[i-1] + commonDiff) {
                return arr[i-1] + commonDiff;
            }
        }
        
        return arr[0];
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        common_diff = (arr[-1] - arr[0]) // n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] != arr[i-1] + common_diff:
                return arr[i-1] + common_diff
        
        return arr[0]
```
