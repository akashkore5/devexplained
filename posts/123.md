### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain four variables to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve after each transaction. At each day, we update these variables based on the prices.

1. `buy1`: The maximum profit after the first buy.
2. `sell1`: The maximum profit after the first sell.
3. `buy2`: The maximum profit after the second buy.
4. `sell2`: The maximum profit after the second sell.

We iterate through the prices array and update these variables accordingly. At the end, `sell2` will hold the maximum profit we can achieve after two transactions.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the prices array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell1 = 0;
        int buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell2 = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buy1 = Math.max(buy1, -price);
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1, buy1 + price);
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - price);
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + price);
        }
        
        return sell2;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy1 = INT_MIN, sell1 = 0;
        int buy2 = INT_MIN, sell2 = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buy1 = max(buy1, -price);
            sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price);
            buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price);
            sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price);
        }
        
        return sell2;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy1 = float('-inf')
        sell1 = 0
        buy2 = float('-inf')
        sell2 = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            buy1 = max(buy1, -price)
            sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)
            buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price)
            sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)
        
        return sell2
