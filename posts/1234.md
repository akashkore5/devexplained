## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We first calculate the frequency of each character in the given string `s`. Then, we iterate through the string with a window of size `n/4` and keep track of the excess characters that need to be replaced to balance the string. We move the window to find the minimum length of the substring that needs to be replaced.

- Calculate the frequency of each character in the string.
- Initialize the window with the size `n/4` and count the excess characters.
- Slide the window to find the minimum length.
- Update the window and count the excess characters until we find the minimum length.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.  
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedString(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] freq = new int[128];
        int count = n / 4;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c]++;
        }

        int start = 0, minLen = n;
        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            freq[s.charAt(end)]--;

            while (start < n && freq['Q'] <= count && freq['W'] <= count && freq['E'] <= count && freq['R'] <= count) {
                minLen = Math.min(minLen, end - start + 1);
                freq[s.charAt(start)]++;
                start++;
            }
        }

        return minLen;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int balancedString(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> freq(128, 0);
        int count = n / 4;

        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c]++;
        }

        int start = 0, minLen = n;
        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            freq[s[end]]--;

            while (start < n && freq['Q'] <= count && freq['W'] <= count && freq['E'] <= count && freq['R'] <= count) {
                minLen = min(minLen, end - start + 1);
                freq[s[start]]++;
                start++;
            }
        }

        return minLen;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def balancedString(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        freq = [0] * 128
        count = n // 4

        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c)] += 1

        start = 0
        min_len = n
        for end in range(n):
            freq[ord(s[end])] -= 1

            while start < n and freq[ord('Q')] <= count and freq[ord('W')] <= count and freq[ord('E')] <= count and freq[ord('R')] <= count:
                min_len = min(min_len, end - start + 1)
                freq[ord(s[start])] += 1
                start += 1

        return min_len
