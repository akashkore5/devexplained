### Explanation

Given a list of comments where each comment contains the id of the post it belongs to, we need to find the number of comments per post. We can achieve this by iterating through the comments and maintaining a map to store the count of comments per post. Finally, we return the count of comments for each post.

- **Algorithmic Idea:**
  1. Initialize a map `postCommentCount` to store the count of comments per post.
  2. Iterate through the comments list, updating the count of comments for each post in the map.
  3. Return the count of comments for each post as a list.

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of comments.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), for the map to store the count of comments per post.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> numOfCommentsPerPost(int[] comments) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> postCommentCount = new HashMap<>();
        for (int comment : comments) {
            postCommentCount.put(comment, postCommentCount.getOrDefault(comment, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int post : postCommentCount.keySet()) {
            result.add(postCommentCount.get(post));
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numOfCommentsPerPost(vector<int>& comments) {
        unordered_map<int, int> postCommentCount;
        for (int comment : comments) {
            postCommentCount[comment]++;
        }
        
        vector<int> result;
        for (auto const& kvp : postCommentCount) {
            result.push_back(kvp.second);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfCommentsPerPost(self, comments: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        postCommentCount = {}
        for comment in comments:
            postCommentCount[comment] = postCommentCount.get(comment, 0) + 1
        
        result = []
        for post in postCommentCount:
            result.append(postCommentCount[post])
        
        return result
```
