## Explanation:
To encode a positive integer, we can convert it to its binary representation and then drop the leading '1'. The encoded result is the binary representation of the original number without the leading '1'.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Convert the given number to its binary representation.
2. Remove the first character ('1') from the binary representation.
3. Return the resulting binary representation.

### Example:
Input: num = 23
Binary representation of 23: 10111
Encoded binary representation: 0111

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) where n is the given number.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) for storing the binary representation.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public String encode(int num) {
        return Integer.toBinaryString(num + 1).substring(1);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string encode(int num) {
        return bitset<32>(num + 1).to_string().substr(1);
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def encode(self, num: int) -> str:
        return bin(num + 1)[3:]
```
