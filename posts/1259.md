### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the number of ways to perform handshakes between people such that no two handshakes cross each other. This can be modeled as finding the number of ways to pair up `n` people where each person shakes hands with exactly one other person in a non-crossing way.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a function `dp[i]` which represents the number of ways to pair up `i` people without any crossing handshakes. We can build up this function iteratively starting from `i=2` up to `n`.

For each `i`, we can iterate over all possible ways to split the `i` people into two groups, and then recursively calculate the number of ways to pair up those two groups. The total number of ways for `i` people can be obtained by summing up the product of the number of ways for the two groups.

The base cases would be `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[2] = 1` since there is only one way to pair up 2 people without crossing.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfWays(int n) {
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[2] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 4; i <= n; i += 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j += 2) {
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 2];
                dp[i] %= 1000000007;
            }
        }
        
        return (int)dp[n];
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(int n) {
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[2] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 4; i <= n; i += 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j += 2) {
                dp[i] += (dp[j] * dp[i - j - 2]) % 1000000007;
                dp[i] %= 1000000007;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[2] = 1
        
        for i in range(4, n + 1, 2):
            for j in range(0, i, 2):
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 2]
                dp[i] %= 1000000007
        
        return dp[n]
```
