### Explanation:
The problem can be solved using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We can start by finding the initial positions of the box, the target, and the player. Then, we can use BFS to explore possible moves while keeping track of the number of pushes needed to move the box to the target.

1. Find the initial positions of the box, target, and player.
2. Perform BFS starting from the player's position, considering both the player's movement and pushing the box.
3. Keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting the same state.
4. Return the minimum number of pushes needed to move the box to the target.

Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
Space Complexity: O(m*n) for the visited states.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPushBox(char[][] grid) {
        // Java solution
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPushBox(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        // C++ solution
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minPushBox(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # Python solution
```
