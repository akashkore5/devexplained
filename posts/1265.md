## Explanation:

To print an immutable singly linked list in reverse order, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to first find the length of the linked list by iterating through it, and then recursively print the nodes in reverse order by traversing the list from the end to the beginning.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:
1. Find the length of the linked list by iterating through it.
2. Define a recursive function that takes the current node and the remaining length as parameters.
3. In the recursive function, if the remaining length is greater than 1, recursively call the function with the next node and decremented remaining length.
4. Print the value of the current node.

Time Complexity:
- Finding the length of the linked list takes O(n) time.
- Printing the nodes in reverse order using recursion also takes O(n) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive calls on the call stack.
