### Explanation:
- We can solve this problem by counting the number of servers in each row and each column.
- For each server, if there is more than one server in its row or column, we increment the total count.
- Finally, we return the total count of servers that can communicate with at least one other server.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countServers(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[] rows = new int[m];
        int[] cols = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    rows[i]++;
                    cols[j]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (rows[i] > 1 || cols[j] > 1)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<int> rows(m, 0);
        vector<int> cols(n, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    rows[i]++;
                    cols[j]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (rows[i] > 1 || cols[j] > 1)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

    def countServers(self, grid: List[List[int]) -> int:
