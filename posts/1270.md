### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can start by creating a graph where the key is the manager and the value is a list of employees reporting to that manager. Then, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given manager to find all employees reporting to this manager.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a graph where the key is the manager and the value is a list of employees reporting to that manager.
2. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given manager to find all employees reporting to this manager.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (managers) and E is the number of edges (relationships between managers and employees).

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(V + E) for storing the graph and the visited set.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> countSubordinates(int n, int[][] manager, int[] informTime) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.putIfAbsent(manager[i][0], new ArrayList<>());
            graph.get(manager[i][0]).add(i);
        }
        return dfs(graph, informTime, 0);
    }
    
    private List<Integer> dfs(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int[] informTime, int manager) {
        List<Integer> subordinates = new ArrayList<>();
        if (graph.containsKey(manager)) {
            for (int subordinate : graph.get(manager)) {
                List<Integer> subordinatesOfSubordinate = dfs(graph, informTime, subordinate);
                subordinates.add(informTime[manager] + Collections.max(subordinatesOfSubordinate));
            }
        }
        return subordinates;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countSubordinates(int n, vector<vector<int>>& manager, vector<int>& informTime) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[manager[i][0]].push_back(i);
        }
        return dfs(graph, informTime, 0);
    }
    
    vector<int> dfs(unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& informTime, int manager) {
        vector<int> subordinates;
        if (graph.find(manager) != graph.end()) {
            for (int subordinate : graph[manager]) {
                vector<int> subordinatesOfSubordinate = dfs(graph, informTime, subordinate);
                subordinates.push_back(informTime[manager] + *max_element(subordinatesOfSubordinate.begin(), subordinatesOfSubordinate.end()));
            }
        }
        return subordinates;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubordinates(self, n: int, manager: List[List[int]], informTime: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(n):
            graph[manager[i][0]].append(i)
        return self.dfs(graph, informTime, 0)
    
    def dfs(self, graph, informTime, manager):
        subordinates = []
        if manager in graph:
            for subordinate in graph[manager]:
                subordinatesOfSubordinate = self.dfs(graph, informTime, subordinate)
                subordinates.append(informTime[manager] + max(subordinatesOfSubordinate))
        return subordinates
