### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can simulate the tic-tac-toe game based on the provided moves and check for a winner or a draw condition after each move. We can represent the game board as a 3x3 grid and keep track of which player made each move. We need to check for winning conditions after each move by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.

1. Initialize a 3x3 grid to represent the tic-tac-toe board.
2. Iterate through the moves array and update the board based on the player's move.
3. After each move, check if there is a winning condition by checking rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive marks by the same player.
4. If a winning condition is met, return the winner (A or B).
5. If all moves are made and no winner is determined, return "Draw".
6. If there are still moves to be made, return "Pending".

Time Complexity: O(1) as there are a limited number of moves in a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using a fixed-size grid to represent the game board.

```java
class Solution {
    public String tictactoe(int[][] moves) {
        char[][] grid = new char[3][3];
        char player = 'X';

        for (int[] move : moves) {
            grid[move[0]][move[1]] = player;
            if (checkWin(grid, move[0], move[1], player)) {
                return player == 'X' ? "A" : "B";
            }
            player = player == 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
        }

        return moves.length == 9 ? "Draw" : "Pending";
    }

    private boolean checkWin(char[][] grid, int row, int col, char player) {
        // Check row
        if (grid[row][0] == player && grid[row][1] == player && grid[row][2] == player) {
            return true;
        }

        // Check column
        if (grid[0][col] == player && grid[1][col] == player && grid[2][col] == player) {
            return true;
        }

        // Check diagonals
        if ((row == col || row + col == 2)
                && ((grid[0][0] == player && grid[1][1] == player && grid[2][2] == player)
                || (grid[0][2] == player && grid[1][1] == player && grid[2][0] == player))) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}

        vector<vector<char>> grid(3, vector<char>(3, ' '));
        char player = 'X';

        for (const auto& move : moves) {
            grid[move[0]][move[1]] = player;
            if (checkWin(grid, move[0], move[1], player)) {
                return player == 'X' ? "A" : "B";
            }
            player = player == 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
        }

        return moves.size() == 9 ? "Draw" : "Pending";
    }

    bool checkWin(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int row, int col, char player) {
        // Check row
        if (grid[row][0] == player && grid[row][1] == player && grid[row][2] == player) {
            return true;
        }

        // Check column
        if (grid[0][col] == player && grid[1][col] == player && grid[2][col] == player) {
            return true;
        }

        // Check diagonals
        if ((row == col || row + col == 2)
                && ((grid[0][0] == player && grid[1][1] == player && grid[2][2] == player)
                || (grid[0][2] == player && grid[1][1] == player && grid[2][0] == player))) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
