## Explanation

To implement a traffic light controlled intersection, we can maintain a queue for each road entering the intersection. The cars will wait in these queues until the traffic light for their road turns green. We will simulate the traffic light switching at a regular interval. 

We can use a variable to keep track of the current active road and another variable to keep track of the time elapsed since the last traffic light change. When the time limit for the current road is reached, we switch to the next road and reset the timer.

```java
class TrafficLight {
    private int currentRoad;
    private int timeLimit;
    private int timeElapsed;
    
    public TrafficLight() {
        currentRoad = 1;
        timeLimit = 0;
        timeElapsed = 0;
    }
    
    public void carArrived(int roadName, int time) {
        if (roadName != currentRoad) {
            timeElapsed = 0;
            currentRoad = roadName;
        }
        
        if (timeElapsed + time <= timeLimit) {
            timeElapsed += time;
        } else {
            timeLimit = time;
            timeElapsed = time;
        }
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class TrafficLight {
private:
    int currentRoad;
    int timeLimit;
    int timeElapsed;

public:
    TrafficLight() {
        currentRoad = 1;
        timeLimit = 0;
        timeElapsed = 0;
    }

    void carArrived(int roadName, int time) {
        if (roadName != currentRoad) {
            timeElapsed = 0;
            currentRoad = roadName;
        }

        if (timeElapsed + time <= timeLimit) {
            timeElapsed += time;
        } else {
            timeLimit = time;
            timeElapsed = time;
        }
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.currentRoad = 1
        self.timeLimit = 0
        self.timeElapsed = 0

    def carArrived(self, roadName, time):
        if roadName != self.currentRoad:
            self.timeElapsed = 0
            self.currentRoad = roadName

        if self.timeElapsed + time <= self.timeLimit:
            self.timeElapsed += time
        else:
            self.timeLimit = time
            self.timeElapsed = time
```
