### Explanation
To solve this problem, we will iterate through the digits of the given number, calculate the product and sum of the digits, and then find the difference between the product and sum. We can obtain the digits of the number by repeatedly dividing it by 10 and extracting the remainder.

- Time complexity: O(log10(n)) where n is the given number
- Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int product = 1, sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            product *= digit;
            sum += digit;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return product - sum;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int product = 1, sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            product *= digit;
            sum += digit;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return product - sum;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
        product = 1
        sum_digits = 0
        while n > 0:
            digit = n % 10
            product *= digit
            sum_digits += digit
            n //= 10
        return product - sum_digits
```
