## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to group the people based on the group size they belong to. We can accomplish this by iterating through the groupSizes array and keeping track of the groups using a hashmap. 

1. Create a hashmap to store the groups where the key is the group size and the value is a list of people in that group.
2. Iterate through the groupSizes array and for each person, add them to the corresponding group in the hashmap.
3. If the size of the group reaches the group size specified, add the group to the result and create a new group.
4. Repeat this process until all people are assigned to groups.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of people, as we iterate through the groupSizes array once. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> groupThePeople(int[] groupSizes) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> groups = new HashMap<>();
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < groupSizes.length; i++) {
            int size = groupSizes[i];
            groups.putIfAbsent(size, new ArrayList<>());
            List<Integer> group = groups.get(size);
            group.add(i);
            
            if (group.size() == size) {
                result.add(new ArrayList<>(group));
                groups.put(size, new ArrayList<>());
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> groupThePeople(vector<int>& groupSizes) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> groups;
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < groupSizes.size(); i++) {
            int size = groupSizes[i];
            groups[size].push_back(i);
            
            if (groups[size].size() == size) {
                result.push_back(groups[size]);
                groups[size].clear();
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def groupThePeople(self, groupSizes: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        groups = {}
        result = []
        
        for i, size in enumerate(groupSizes):
            groups.setdefault(size, []).append(i)
            
            if len(groups[size]) == size:
                result.append(groups[size])
                groups[size] = []
        
        return result
```
