### Explanation:
To convert the binary number represented by a linked list to an integer, we can traverse the linked list from the head to the tail while calculating the decimal value as we go. We initialize the result as 0 and for each node, we shift the result to the left by 1 (equivalent to multiplying by 2) and add the value of the current node. By doing this for all nodes, we can reconstruct the decimal value represented by the binary linked list.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize result as 0.
2. Traverse the linked list from head to tail.
3. For each node:
   - Multiply the result by 2 (left shift) to make space for the next bit.
   - Add the value of the current node to the result.
4. Return the final result as the decimal value.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        int result = 0;
        while (head != null) {
            result = (result << 1) + head.val;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int result = 0;
        while (head != nullptr) {
            result = (result << 1) + head->val;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        result = 0
        while head:
            result = (result << 1) + head.val
            head = head.next
        return result
```
