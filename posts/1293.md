## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm. We will maintain a priority queue to explore the grid cells in a breadth-first search manner while keeping track of the number of obstacles eliminated so far. We will store the current position, the number of steps taken, and the number of obstacles eliminated in the priority queue. We will continue exploring cells until we reach the destination or exhaust all possibilities.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a priority queue to store the current position, steps taken, and obstacles eliminated.
2. Add the starting cell (0, 0) to the priority queue with steps = 0 and obstacles eliminated = 0.
3. Initialize a 2D array `visited` to keep track of the minimum obstacles eliminated at each cell.
4. Initialize directions for movement: up, down, left, right.
5. While the priority queue is not empty:
   - Pop the cell with the smallest number of steps from the priority queue.
   - If the current cell is the destination, return the number of steps taken.
   - Iterate through all possible directions and check if the new position is within bounds and not an obstacle.
   - If the new position is valid and can be reached with fewer obstacles eliminated, add it to the priority queue.
6. If no path is found, return -1.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m*n*k*log(m*n)) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and k is the maximum number of obstacles that can be eliminated.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(m*n*k) for the priority queue and the visited array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestPath(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]));
        pq.offer(new int[]{0, 0, 0});
        int[][] visited = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(visited[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int r = curr[0], c = curr[1], o = curr[2];
            if (r == m - 1 && c == n - 1) return visited[r][c];

                        visited[newRow][newCol] = newObstacles;
                        pq.offer(new int[]{newRow, newCol, newObstacles});
