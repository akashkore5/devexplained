### Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate through the array of numbers and count the number of digits in each number. If the count is even, we increment a counter. Finally, we return this counter as the result. The number of digits in a number can be calculated by taking the log base 10 of the number and adding 1 to it. We can then check if this count is even and update the counter accordingly.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int digits = (int) (Math.log10(num) + 1);
            if (digits % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int digits = log10(num) + 1;
            if (digits % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            digits = len(str(num))
            if digits % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
```
