### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the team size given a list of integers representing the number of people in each group. The team size is the number of people in the largest group.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of group sizes while keeping track of the maximum group size encountered so far.

- Initialize a variable `maxSize` to 0.
- Iterate through the list of group sizes.
- Update `maxSize` if the current group size is greater than `maxSize`.
- Return `maxSize` as the result.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTeamSize(int[] nums) {
        int maxSize = 0;
        for (int size : nums) {
            maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, size);
        }
        return maxSize;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTeamSize(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxSize = 0;
        for (int size : nums) {
            maxSize = max(maxSize, size);
        }
        return maxSize;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def findTeamSize(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSize = 0
        for size in nums:
            maxSize = max(maxSize, size)
        return maxSize
```
