## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the moving average of the amount paid by customers in a seven-day window for each date. We can achieve this by using a sliding window approach.

1. We will iterate over the Customer table ordered by visited_on.
2. For each customer visit, we will add the amount to the sum of the current window.
3. If the window size exceeds 7 days, we will subtract the amount from the customer visit that falls outside the 7-day window.
4. We will calculate the moving average by dividing the sum of the window by 7.
5. We will round the average to two decimal places.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of customer visits.
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
