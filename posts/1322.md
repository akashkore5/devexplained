## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage of ads that received positive feedback based on the given input arrays of the number of clicks and the number of impressions for each ad. 

We can calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for each ad by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. If the CTR is greater than or equal to 1%, we consider it a positive feedback ad.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:
1. Initialize a variable `positiveAds` to keep track of the number of ads with positive feedback.
2. Iterate through each ad and calculate the CTR using the formula `clicks / impressions * 100`.
3. If the CTR is greater than or equal to 1%, increment the `positiveAds` count.
4. Finally, return the percentage of positive feedback ads by dividing `positiveAds` by the total number of ads and multiplying by 100.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of ads
Space Complexity: O(1)

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] percentageAds(int[] clicks, int[] impressions) {
        int positiveAds = 0;
        int n = clicks.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            double ctr = (double)clicks[i] / impressions[i] * 100;
            if (ctr >= 1.0) {
                positiveAds++;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{positiveAds * 100 / n};
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> percentageAds(vector<int>& clicks, vector<int>& impressions) {
        int positiveAds = 0;
        int n = clicks.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            double ctr = (double)clicks[i] / impressions[i] * 100;
            if (ctr >= 1.0) {
                positiveAds++;
            }
        }
        
        return {positiveAds * 100 / n};
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def percentageAds(self, clicks: List[int], impressions: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        positiveAds = 0
        n = len(clicks)
        
        for i in range(n):
            ctr = clicks[i] / impressions[i] * 100
            if ctr >= 1.0:
                positiveAds += 1
        
        return [positiveAds * 100 // n]
```
