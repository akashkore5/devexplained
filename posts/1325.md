## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the binary tree. At each node, we recursively check its left and right children. If a child is a leaf node and has the value equal to the target, we can remove that child by setting it to null. We continue this process until no more leaf nodes with the target value exist.

### Algorithm:
1. Recursively traverse the tree using DFS.
2. For each node, check if its left and right children are leaf nodes with the target value.
3. If a child is a leaf node with the target value, set that child to null.
4. Repeat this process until no more leaf nodes with the target value exist.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursive stack space used during the DFS traversal.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);
        root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);
        
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && root.val == target) {
            return null;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
        
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr && root->val == target) {
            delete root;
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeLeafNodes(self, root: TreeNode, target: int) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)
        root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)
        
        if not root.left and not root.right and root.val == target:
            return None
        
        return root
```
