### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to join the `Products` and `Orders` tables on the `product_id` column and filter the results based on the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. We need to sum the `unit` values for each product ordered in February 2020 and select only those products that have at least 100 units ordered.

1. Join the `Products` and `Orders` tables on `product_id`.
2. Filter the results to include only orders from February 2020.
3. Group the results by `product_id` and sum the `unit` values.
4. Filter the grouped results to include only products with a total of at least 100 units ordered.
5. Select the `product_name` and total `unit` for each qualifying product.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of rows in the combined `Orders` and `Products` tables.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of rows in the combined `Orders` and `Products` tables.
