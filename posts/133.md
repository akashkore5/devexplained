## Explanation

To clone a graph, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the original graph while creating copies of the nodes and their neighbors in the new graph. We can use a hashmap to keep track of the nodes we have already cloned to avoid duplicating nodes.

1. Create a hashmap to store the mapping between original nodes and their corresponding clones.
2. Start DFS traversal from the given node.
3. For each neighbor of the current node, check if it has already been cloned. If not, create a clone and recursively call the DFS function on the neighbor.
4. Return the clone of the given node.

The time complexity of this approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is also O(V) to store the mapping between nodes.

```java
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        
        Map<Node, Node> cloneMap = new HashMap<>();
        return cloneNode(node, cloneMap);
    }
    
    private Node cloneNode(Node node, Map<Node, Node> cloneMap) {
        if (cloneMap.containsKey(node)) {
            return cloneMap.get(node);
        }
        
        Node clone = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>());
        cloneMap.put(node, clone);
        
        for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
            clone.neighbors.add(cloneNode(neighbor, cloneMap));
        }
        
        return clone;
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if (node == nullptr) return nullptr;
        
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> cloneMap;
        return cloneNode(node, cloneMap);
    }
    
private:
    Node* cloneNode(Node* node, unordered_map<Node*, Node*>& cloneMap) {
        if (cloneMap.count(node)) {
            return cloneMap[node];
        }
        
        Node* clone = new Node(node->val, {});
        cloneMap[node] = clone;
        
        for (Node* neighbor : node->neighbors) {
            clone->neighbors.push_back(cloneNode(neighbor, cloneMap));
        }
        
        return clone;
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None
        
        clone_map = {}
        return self.cloneNode(node, clone_map)
    
    def cloneNode(self, node, clone_map):
        if node in clone_map:
            return clone_map[node]
        
        clone = Node(node.val, [])
        clone_map[node] = clone
        
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            clone.neighbors.append(self.cloneNode(neighbor, clone_map))
        
        return clone
```
