### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given array of restaurants and filter out the ones that meet the given criteria: veganFriendly, maxPrice, and maxDistance. We will then sort the remaining restaurants based on their rating (from highest to lowest) and if two restaurants have the same rating, we will order them by id from highest to lowest.

### Algorithm

1. Iterate through each restaurant in the input array.
2. Check if the restaurant satisfies the filtering criteria (veganFriendly, maxPrice, maxDistance).
3. Store the restaurant ID along with its rating in a map if it passes the filtering criteria.
4. Sort the restaurants based on rating (descending) and then by ID (descending).
5. Return the IDs of the filtered and sorted restaurants.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) where n is the number of restaurants in the input array.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the filtered restaurants.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> filterRestaurants(int[][] restaurants, int veganFriendly, int maxPrice, int maxDistance) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> filteredRestaurants = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int[] restaurant : restaurants) {
            int id = restaurant[0];
            int rating = restaurant[1];
            int isVeganFriendly = restaurant[2];
            int price = restaurant[3];
            int distance = restaurant[4];
            
            if ((veganFriendly == 0 || isVeganFriendly == veganFriendly) && price <= maxPrice && distance <= maxDistance) {
                filteredRestaurants.put(id, rating);
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(filteredRestaurants.keySet());
        Collections.sort(result, (a, b) -> {
            if (filteredRestaurants.get(a).equals(filteredRestaurants.get(b))) {
                return b - a;
            }
            return filteredRestaurants.get(b) - filteredRestaurants.get(a);
        });
        
        return result;
    }
