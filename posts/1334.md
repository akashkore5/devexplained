### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between each pair of cities. Then, for each city, we can count the number of cities that are reachable within the given distance threshold. Finally, we return the city with the smallest number of reachable cities, and if there are multiple cities with the same number of reachable cities, we return the city with the greatest number.

1. Initialize a 2D array `distances` of size `n x n` to store the shortest distances between cities.
2. Initialize the `distances` array with the weight of direct edges and set infinity for non-existent edges.
3. Run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to update `distances` array with the shortest paths.
4. For each city, count the number of reachable cities within the distance threshold.
5. Return the city with the smallest number of reachable cities, and if there are multiple cities with the same number, return the city with the greatest number.

Time complexity: O(n^3) - for running Floyd-Warshall algorithm  
Space complexity: O(n^2) - for the distances array

    public int findTheCity(int n, int[][] edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        int[][] distances = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(distances[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            distances[i][i] = 0;
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            distances[edge[0]][edge[1]] = edge[2];
