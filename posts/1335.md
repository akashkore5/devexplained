### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum difficulty to finish the first `i` jobs in `j` days. We will iterate over the jobs and days, updating the `dp` array based on the maximum difficulty for each day.

1. Initialize the `dp` array with size `n+1` by `d+1`, where `n` is the number of jobs.
2. Set `dp[0][0] = 0` since there is no difficulty if there are no jobs and days.
3. Iterate over the jobs and days:
   - For each job `i`, update `dp[i][j]` by considering all previous jobs and days.
   - Calculate the maximum difficulty for each day based on the current job and update `dp[i][j]`.
4. The minimum difficulty to finish all jobs in `d` days is `dp[n][d]`. If it is `INF`, return `-1`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * d), where n is the number of jobs and d is the number of days.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this solution is O(n * d).
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.length;
        if (n < d) return -1;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][d + 1];
        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= d; j++) {
                int maxDifficulty = 0;
                for (int k = i - 1; k >= j - 1; k--) {
                    maxDifficulty = Math.max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[k]);
                    if (dp[k][j - 1] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[k][j - 1] + maxDifficulty);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][d] != Integer.MAX_VALUE ? dp[n][d] : -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifficulty(vector<int>& jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.size();
        if (n < d) return -1;
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(d + 1, INT_MAX));
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= d; j++) {
                int maxDifficulty = 0;
                for (int k = i - 1; k >= j - 1; k--) {
                    maxDifficulty = max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[k]);
                    if (dp[k][j - 1] != INT_MAX) {
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[k][j - 1] + maxDifficulty);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][d] != INT_MAX ? dp[n][d] : -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifficulty(self, jobDifficulty: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(jobDifficulty)
        if n < d:
            return -1
        
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (d + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, d + 1):
                maxDifficulty = 0
                for k in range(i - 1, j - 2, -1):
                    maxDifficulty = max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[k])
                    if dp[k][j - 1] != float('inf'):
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[k][j - 1] + maxDifficulty)
        
        return dp[n][d] if dp[n][d] != float('inf') else -1
