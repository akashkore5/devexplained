## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can make up to visit `j` with `i` transactions. We can then iterate over the transactions and visits to fill in the `dp` array based on the following conditions:
- If we do not make a transaction at visit `j`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]` since the profit remains the same.
- If we make a transaction at visit `j`, then we need to consider the maximum profit we can get by either selling at visit `j` or carrying over the profit from previous visits with one less transaction.

Finally, the answer will be the maximum profit we can make with the given number of transactions.

**Time Complexity:** O(transactions * visits)
**Space Complexity:** O(transactions * visits)

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] visits, int transactions) {
        int n = visits.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[transactions + 1][n];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= transactions; i++) {
            int maxDiff = -visits[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], visits[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - visits[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[transactions][n - 1];
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& visits, int transactions) {
        int n = visits.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(transactions + 1, vector<int>(n));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= transactions; i++) {
            int maxDiff = -visits[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], visits[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - visits[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[transactions][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, visits: List[int], transactions: int) -> int:
        n = len(visits)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(transactions + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, transactions + 1):
            maxDiff = -visits[0]
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], visits[j] + maxDiff)
                maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - visits[j])
        
        return dp[transactions][n - 1]
```
