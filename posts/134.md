### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of a circular trip. We iterate over all gas stations and calculate the total gas left after reaching each station. If at any point the total gas becomes negative, we reset our starting station to the next station and reset the total gas to 0.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `totalGas` and `startStation` to 0.
2. Iterate over all gas stations:
   - Calculate the total gas by adding the gas at the current station and subtracting the cost to reach the next station.
   - If the total gas becomes negative, update `startStation` to the next station and reset `totalGas` to 0.
3. After completing the loop, check if the total gas is non-negative. If yes, return the `startStation`, otherwise return -1.

Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate over all gas stations once.
Space Complexity: O(1) - We use only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int startStation = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (tank < 0) {
                startStation = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return totalGas >= totalCost ? startStation : -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int totalGas = 0;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int startStation = 0;
        int tank = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (tank < 0) {
                startStation = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return totalGas >= totalCost ? startStation : -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        totalGas = 0
        totalCost = 0
        startStation = 0
        tank = 0
        
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            totalGas += gas[i]
            totalCost += cost[i]
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if tank < 0:
                startStation = i + 1
                tank = 0
        
        return startStation if totalGas >= totalCost else -1
