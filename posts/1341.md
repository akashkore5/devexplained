### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the user who has rated the greatest number of movies and the movie with the highest average rating in February 2020. We can achieve this by performing two separate operations:
1. Count the number of movies each user has rated and find the user with the maximum count. If there is a tie, return the user with the lexicographically smallest name.
2. Calculate the average rating of each movie in February 2020 and find the movie with the highest average rating. If there is a tie, return the movie with the lexicographically smallest name.
