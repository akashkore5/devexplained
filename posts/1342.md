### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iteratively perform the given operations on the number until it reaches zero. We check if the number is even, then divide by 2, otherwise subtract 1. We keep track of the number of steps taken and return this count as the result.

- **Algorithm:**
  1. Initialize a variable `steps` to 0.
  2. While `num` is greater than 0:
     - If `num` is even, divide it by 2.
     - If `num` is odd, subtract 1 from it.
     - Increment `steps` by 1.
  3. Return `steps`.

- **Time Complexity:** O(log(num)) - as the number is halved at each step.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - only constant space is used.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps (int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num -= 1;
            }
            steps++;
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSteps (int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num -= 1;
            }
            steps++;
        }
        return steps;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while num > 0:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                num //= 2
            else:
                num -= 1
            steps += 1
        return steps
```
