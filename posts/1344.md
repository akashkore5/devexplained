## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour or 0.5 degrees per minute. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute. We calculate the angles made by the hour and minute hands from the 12 o'clock position, then find the absolute difference between these angles. The minimum angle between the two hands will be the smaller of the two angles or the absolute difference if they cross over each other.
```java
class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60.0) * 30;
        double minuteAngle = minutes * 6;
        
        double angle = Math.abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle);
        return Math.min(angle, 360 - angle);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60.0) * 30;
        double minuteAngle = minutes * 6;
        
        double angle = abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle);
        return min(angle, 360 - angle);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:
        hour_angle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60) * 30
        minute_angle = minutes * 6
        
        angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)
        return min(angle, 360 - angle)
```
