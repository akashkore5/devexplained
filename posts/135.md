### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can follow the following steps:
1. Initialize an array `candies` with all elements as 1. This represents each child initially getting one candy.
2. Traverse the `ratings` array from left to right and compare each child's rating with its left neighbor. If the current child's rating is greater than the left neighbor's rating, update the candies assigned to the current child to be one more than the left neighbor's candies.
3. Traverse the `ratings` array from right to left and do the same comparison with the right neighbor. If the current child's rating is greater than the right neighbor's rating and the current child's candies are not already greater than or equal to the right neighbor's candies, update the candies assigned to the current child to be one more than the right neighbor's candies.
4. The total number of candies needed is the sum of all elements in the `candies` array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        int totalCandies = candies[n - 1];
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
            totalCandies += candies[i];
        }
        
        return totalCandies;
    }
}
```

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        int totalCandies = candies[n - 1];

            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }

        }
