### Explanation

Given a list of students with their departments and a list of valid departments, we need to find and return a list of students who are in invalid departments.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of students and for each student, check if their department is not in the list of valid departments. If the department is invalid, we add the student to the result list.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store students with invalid departments.
2. Iterate through each student in the input list.
3. For each student, check if their department is not in the list of valid departments.
4. If the department is not valid, add the student to the `result` list.
5. Return the `result` list containing students with invalid departments.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of students in the input list.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of students with invalid departments.
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> getInvalidDepartments(List<List<String>> students, List<String> validDepartments) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (List<String> student : students) {
            String department = student.get(1);
            if (!validDepartments.contains(department)) {
                result.add(student.get(0));
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::string> getInvalidDepartments(std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>& students, std::vector<std::string>& validDepartments) {
        std::vector<std::string> result;
        std::unordered_set<std::string> validSet(validDepartments.begin(), validDepartments.end());
        
        for (const auto& student : students) {
            std::string department = student[1];
            if (validSet.find(department) == validSet.end()) {
                result.push_back(student[0]);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getInvalidDepartments(self, students: List[List[str]], validDepartments: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        validSet = set(validDepartments)
        
        for student in students:
            department = student[1]
            if department not in validSet:
                result.append(student[0])
        
        return result
```
