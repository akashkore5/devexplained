## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the events based on their end day in ascending order.
2. Initialize a set to keep track of the events that can be attended.
3. Iterate through the sorted events:
   - For each event, iterate from the start day to end day. If a day is found that is not in the set, attend the event on that day and add it to the set.
4. Return the size of the set, which represents the maximum number of events that can be attended.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of events, due to sorting.
Space complexity: O(n) to store the set of days.
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        Set<Integer> attended = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] event : events) {
            for (int i = event[0]; i <= event[1]; i++) {
                if (!attended.contains(i)) {
                    attended.add(i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return attended.size();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        unordered_set<int> attended;
        for (const vector<int>& event : events) {
            for (int i = event[0]; i <= event[1]; i++) {
                if (attended.find(i) == attended.end()) {
                    attended.insert(i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return attended.size();
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        attended = set()
        for event in events:
            for day in range(event[0], event[1] + 1):
                if day not in attended:
                    attended.add(day)
                    break
        return len(attended)
```
