## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to find the list of participants who attended at least one activity. We can achieve this by iterating through the activities and maintaining a set of unique participants.

1. We will iterate through the `activities` list and add each participant to a set.
2. After iterating through all activities, we will have a set of unique participants who attended at least one activity.
3. Finally, we will convert the set back to a list and return it as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the total number of participants across all activities.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is also O(n), where n is the total number of participants across all activities.

:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> mostActive(List<String> activities) {
        Set<String> participants = new HashSet<>();
        for (String activity : activities) {
            participants.add(activity);
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(participants);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> mostActive(vector<string>& activities) {
        unordered_set<string> participants;
        for (const string& activity : activities) {
            participants.insert(activity);
        }
        return vector<string>(participants.begin(), participants.end());
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def mostActive(self, activities: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        participants = set()
        for activity in activities:
            participants.add(activity)
        return list(participants)
```
