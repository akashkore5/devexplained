### Explanation
To count all valid pickup and delivery options, we can use a combinatorial approach. For each pair of pickup and delivery, there are two possible positions: pickup before delivery or delivery before pickup. Therefore, for n orders, there are 2n possible positions to arrange the pickups and deliveries. The total number of valid sequences will be the number of ways to select n positions out of 2n. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: C(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! * n!).

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOrders(int n) {
        long ans = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans = (ans * (2 * i - 1) * i) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
        long long ans = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans = (ans * (2 * i - 1) * i) % 1000000007;
        }
        return (int) ans;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countOrders(self, n: int) -> int:
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            ans = (ans * (2 * i - 1) * i) % 1000000007
        return ans
```
