### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of votes each team received for each rank and then sort the teams based on these counts. If there is a tie in the number of first-place votes, we move to the second-place votes, and so on until the tie is broken. If teams are still tied after considering all positions, we sort them alphabetically based on their team letter.

1. Initialize a map to store the vote counts for each team at each rank.
2. Iterate through the votes and update the counts in the map.
3. Implement a custom comparator to sort the teams based on vote counts.
4. Sort the teams using the custom comparator.
5. Generate the final sorted string based on the sorted teams.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is O(n * m * log(m)), where n is the number of votes and m is the number of teams (26 in this case).

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(m^2), where m is the number of teams.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String rankTeams(String[] votes) {
        int n = votes[0].length();
        
        Map<Character, int[]> teamVotes = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String vote : votes) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                char team = vote.charAt(i);
                teamVotes.putIfAbsent(team, new int[n]);
                teamVotes.get(team)[i]++;
            }
        }
        
        List<Character> teams = new ArrayList<>(teamVotes.keySet());
        
        Collections.sort(teams, (a, b) -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (teamVotes.get(a)[i] != teamVotes.get(b)[i]) {
                    return teamVotes.get(b)[i] - teamVotes.get(a)[i];
                }
            }
            return a - b;
        });
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char team : teams) {
            sb.append(team);
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {

        int n = votes[0].size();
        
        map<char, vector<int>> teamVotes;
        
        for (string vote : votes) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                char team = vote[i];
                teamVotes[team].resize(n, 0);
                teamVotes[team][i]++;
            }
        }
        
        vector<char> teams;
        for (auto& entry : teamVotes) {
            teams.push_back(entry.first);
        }
        
        sort(teams.begin(), teams.end(), [&](char& a, char& b) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (teamVotes[a][i] != teamVotes[b][i]) {
                    return teamVotes[b][i] > teamVotes[a][i];
                }
            }
            return a < b;
        });
        
        string res = "";
        for (char team : teams) {
            res += team;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

```python
class Solution:
    def rankTeams(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        n = len(votes[0])
