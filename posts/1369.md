## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can maintain a hashmap to store the most recent occurrence of each activity. We iterate through the given list of activities, updating the hashmap with the latest timestamp of each activity. Finally, we extract the second most recent activity based on the timestamp stored in the hashmap.

- Start by initializing an empty hashmap to store activities and their timestamps.
- Iterate through the list of activities and update the hashmap with the latest timestamp of each activity.
- Extract the activity with the second most recent timestamp from the hashmap.
- Return the second most recent activity.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of activities in the input list.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(N) to store the hashmap where N is the number of activities in the input list.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public String secondMostRecentActivity(String[] activities) {
        Map<String, Integer> activityMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String activity : activities) {
            activityMap.put(activity, activityMap.getOrDefault(activity, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> maxHeap = 
            new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b.getValue(), a.getValue()));
        maxHeap.addAll(activityMap.entrySet());
        
        maxHeap.poll(); // Skip the most recent activity
        return maxHeap.poll().getKey();
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string secondMostRecentActivity(vector<string>& activities) {
        unordered_map<string, int> activityMap;
        
        for (const string& activity : activities) {
            activityMap[activity]++;
        }
        
        priority_queue<pair<int, string>> maxHeap;
        for (auto& entry : activityMap) {
            maxHeap.push({entry.second, entry.first});
        }
        
        maxHeap.pop(); // Skip the most recent activity
        return maxHeap.top().second;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def secondMostRecentActivity(self, activities: List[str]) -> str:
        activityMap = {}
        
        for activity in activities:
            if activity in activityMap:
                activityMap[activity] += 1
            else:
                activityMap[activity] = 1
        
        maxHeap = [(-freq, activity) for activity, freq in activityMap.items()]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
        
        heapq.heappop(maxHeap)  # Skip the most recent activity
        return heapq.heappop(maxHeap)[1]
```
