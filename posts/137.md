### Explanation
To solve this problem with linear runtime complexity and constant extra space, we can utilize bitwise operations, specifically bitwise manipulation. The key idea is to count the occurrences of each bit position in all the numbers and then use bitwise operations to determine the single number that appears once.

We can iterate through all the numbers and keep track of the total count of each bit position mod 3. This way, for each bit position, we will have either 0 or 1 as the count, representing the single number.

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Initialize three variables `ones`, `twos`, and `common`. Initially, set `ones` to 0, `twos` to 0, and `common` to 0.
2. Iterate through each number in the array:
   - Update `twos` to include the common bits between `twos` and the current number.
   - Update `ones` to include the common bits between `ones` and the current number, but not in `twos`.
   - Update `common` by bitwise ANDing `ones` and `twos` to reset the common bits in `ones` and `twos`.
3. Return `ones` as the single number that appears once.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ones = 0, twos = 0, common = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            twos |= ones & num;
            ones ^= num;
            common = ones & twos;
            ones &= ~common;
            twos &= ~common;
        }
        return ones;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ones = 0, twos = 0, common = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            twos |= ones & num;
            ones ^= num;
            common = ones & twos;
            ones &= ~common;
            twos &= ~common;
        }
        return ones;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ones, twos, common = 0, 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            twos |= ones & num
            ones ^= num
            common = ones & twos
            ones &= ~common
            twos &= ~common
        return ones
```
