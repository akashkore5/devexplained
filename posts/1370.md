## Explanation:
This problem requires us to reorder a given string according to a specific algorithm. We need to repeatedly find the smallest and largest characters from the remaining string and append them to the result string in a specific order. We continue this process until all characters are used.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Count the occurrences of each character in the input string.
2. Create a result string to store the reordered characters.
3. Loop through the characters in ascending order until the result string is the same length as the input string:
   - Find and append the smallest character that has remaining occurrences.
   - Find and append the smallest character greater than the last appended character.
   - Find and append the largest character that has remaining occurrences.
   - Find and append the largest character smaller than the last appended character.
4. Return the result string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array to count character occurrences.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String sortString(String s) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (sb.length() < s.length()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (count[i] > 0) {
                    sb.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    count[i]--;
                }
            }
            
            for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (count[i] > 0) {
                    sb.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    count[i]--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string sortString(string s) {
        vector<int> count(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        string result = "";
        while (result.length() < s.length()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (count[i] > 0) {
                    result += ('a' + i);
                    count[i]--;
                }
            }
            
            for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (count[i] > 0) {
                    result += ('a' + i);
                    count[i]--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def sortString(self, s: str) -> str:
        count = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        result = ""
        while len(result) < len(s):
            for i in range(26):
                if count[i] > 0:
                    result += chr(ord('a') + i)
                    count[i] -= 1
            
            for i in range(25, -1, -1):
                if count[i] > 0:
                    result += chr(ord('a') + i)
                    count[i] -= 1
        
        return result
