### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to perform a left join operation on the two tables using the `id` column as the join condition. We will replace the `id` column in the Employees table with the `unique_id` column from the EmployeeUNI table. If an employee does not have a corresponding unique_id, we will show null for that employee.

1. We will use a LEFT JOIN query to combine the two tables on the `id` column.
2. We will select the `unique_id` column from the EmployeeUNI table and the `name` column from the Employees table.
3. If there is no corresponding `unique_id` for an employee, we will show null for that employee.

Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of rows in the Employees table and m is the number of rows in the EmployeeUNI table.
Space complexity: O(n + m) for storing the result.

```java
# Write your Java solution here
String sql = "SELECT EmployeeUNI.unique_id, Employees.name " +
             "FROM Employees LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI " +
             "ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id";
```

#### C++
```cpp
// Write your C++ solution here
string sql = "SELECT EmployeeUNI.unique_id, Employees.name "
             "FROM Employees LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI "
             "ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id";
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
sql = "SELECT EmployeeUNI.unique_id, Employees.name " \
      "FROM Employees LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI " \
      "ON Employees.id = EmployeeUNI.id"
```
