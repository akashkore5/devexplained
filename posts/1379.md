## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to traverse both the original and cloned binary trees simultaneously to find the corresponding node in the clone of the tree for the given target node.

We can perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on both trees at the same time. When we find the target node in the original tree, we return the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

### Algorithm:
1. Start a DFS traversal on both the original and cloned trees.
2. At each step, compare the current node in the original tree with the target node.
3. If the current node in the original tree is the target node, return the current node in the cloned tree.
4. Recursively search the left and right subtrees of both trees.
5. Return the corresponding node in the cloned tree when found.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

```java
class Solution {
    public final TreeNode getTargetCopy(final TreeNode original, final TreeNode cloned, final TreeNode target) {
        if (original == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (original == target) {
            return cloned;
        }
        TreeNode left = getTargetCopy(original.left, cloned.left, target);
        if (left != null) {
            return left;
        }
        return getTargetCopy(original.right, cloned.right, target);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* getTargetCopy(TreeNode* original, TreeNode* cloned, TreeNode* target) {
        if (original == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        if (original == target) {
            return cloned;
        }
        TreeNode* left = getTargetCopy(original->left, cloned->left, target);
        if (left != nullptr) {
            return left;
        }
        return getTargetCopy(original->right, cloned->right, target);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getTargetCopy(self, original: TreeNode, cloned: TreeNode, target: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not original:
            return None
        if original == target:
            return cloned
        left = self.getTargetCopy(original.left, cloned.left, target)
        if left:
            return left
        return self.getTargetCopy(original.right, cloned.right, target)
