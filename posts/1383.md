## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can sort the engineers by efficiency in descending order. Then, we iterate through each engineer starting from the most efficient one. For each engineer, we calculate the maximum performance that can be achieved by including this engineer and at most k - 1 engineers with higher efficiency. We keep track of the total speed of the selected engineers and the minimum efficiency encountered so far. At each step, we update the maximum performance if the current performance is greater.

By iterating through the engineers sorted by efficiency, we ensure that for each engineer we consider, we have already included the k - 1 most efficient engineers before them. This guarantees that we are selecting the most efficient team possible.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting the engineers by efficiency and a space complexity of O(n) to store the engineers.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPerformance(int n, int[] speed, int[] efficiency, int k) {
        int[][] engineers = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            engineers[i] = new int[]{efficiency[i], speed[i]};
        }
        Arrays.sort(engineers, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(k, (a, b) -> a - b);
        long totalSpeed = 0, maxPerformance = 0;
        for (int[] engineer : engineers) {
            int currEfficiency = engineer[0];
            int currSpeed = engineer[1];
            
            pq.offer(currSpeed);
            totalSpeed += currSpeed;
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                totalSpeed -= pq.poll();
            }
            
            maxPerformance = Math.max(maxPerformance, totalSpeed * currEfficiency);
        }
        
        return (int) (maxPerformance % 1000000007);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPerformance(int n, vector<int>& speed, vector<int>& efficiency, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> engineers(n, vector<int>(2));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            engineers[i] = {efficiency[i], speed[i]};
        }
        sort(engineers.begin(), engineers.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] > b[0];
        });
        
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        long totalSpeed = 0, maxPerformance = 0;
        for (const auto& engineer : engineers) {
            int currEfficiency = engineer[0];
            int currSpeed = engineer[1];
            
            pq.push(currSpeed);
            totalSpeed += currSpeed;
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                totalSpeed -= pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
            
            maxPerformance = max(maxPerformance, totalSpeed * currEfficiency);
        }
        
        return maxPerformance % 1000000007;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        engineers = sorted(zip(efficiency, speed), reverse=True)
        
        pq = []
        total_speed = 0
        max_performance = 0
        
        for curr_efficiency, curr_speed in engineers:
            heapq.heappush(pq, curr_speed)
            total_speed += curr_speed
            
            if len(pq) > k:
                total_speed -= heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            max_performance = max(max_performance, total_speed * curr_efficiency)
        
        return max_performance % (10**9 + 7)
