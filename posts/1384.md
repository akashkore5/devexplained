## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the `Product` table and calculate the total sales amount per year for each product. We will use a HashMap to store the total sales amount for each year. Then, we can iterate through the HashMap to generate the desired result.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a HashMap to store the total sales amount per year.
2. Iterate through the `Product` table.
3. For each product, calculate the total sales amount and update the HashMap accordingly.
4. Iterate through the HashMap to generate the result in the required format.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Product` table.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the number of unique years in the `Product` table.

:
```java
SELECT product_id,
       sum(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2008 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2008`,
       sum(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2009 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2009`,
       sum(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2010 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2010`
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

### C++:
```cpp
SELECT product_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2008 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2008`,
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2009 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2009`,
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2010 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2010`
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

### Python:
```python
SELECT product_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2008 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2008`,
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2009 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2009`,
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2010 THEN sale_amount ELSE 0 END) AS `2010`
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```
