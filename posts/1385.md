### Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate through each element in `arr1` and for each element, we check if there exists an element in `arr2` such that the absolute difference between the two elements is less than or equal to `d`. If such an element exists, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the count as the distance value between the two arrays.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
  2. Iterate through each element `num1` in `arr1`.
  3. For each `num1`, iterate through each element `num2` in `arr2`.
  4. Check if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `d`.
  5. If there is no such element in `arr2`, increment the counter by 1.
  6. Return the counter as the distance value.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m) where n is the length of `arr1` and m is the length of `arr2`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheDistanceValue(int[] arr1, int[] arr2, int d) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num1 : arr1) {
            boolean found = false;
            for (int num2 : arr2) {
                if (Math.abs(num1 - num2) <= d) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheDistanceValue(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2, int d) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num1 : arr1) {
            bool found = false;
            for (int num2 : arr2) {
                if (abs(num1 - num2) <= d) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDistanceValue(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for num1 in arr1:
            found = False
            for num2 in arr2:
                if abs(num1 - num2) <= d:
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                count += 1
        return count
```
