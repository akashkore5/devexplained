### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given table of stock transactions and calculate the capital gains or losses for each stock. We can achieve this by maintaining a hashmap to keep track of the total capital gain/loss for each stock. We iterate through the transactions and update the hashmap accordingly.

1. Initialize a hashmap to store the total capital gain/loss for each stock.
2. Iterate through the stock transactions:
   - For each "Buy" operation, calculate the difference between the buying price and add it to the hashmap.
   - For each "Sell" operation, calculate the difference between the selling price and subtract it from the hashmap.
3. Return the result table with stock names and their capital gain/loss.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of transactions in the table.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the hashmap to store the capital gain/loss for each stock.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT stock_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price * -1 ELSE price END) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT stock_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price * -1 ELSE price END) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT stock_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN operation = 'Sell' THEN price * -1 ELSE price END) AS capital_gain_loss
FROM Stocks
GROUP BY stock_name
```
