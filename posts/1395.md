## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible triplets of soldiers and check if they form a valid team according to the given conditions. We can keep track of the count of valid teams formed. We can do this by maintaining two arrays `smaller` and `larger` for each soldier, representing the count of soldiers with smaller and larger ratings respectively. For each soldier, we can count the number of valid teams that can be formed using that soldier as the middle element in the triplet.

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the total number of valid teams.
2. Initialize two arrays `smaller` and `larger` of size `n`, all initialized to 0.
3. For each soldier at index `i`:
   - Iterate through all soldiers with index `j < i`:
     - If `rating[j] < rating[i]`, increment `smaller[i]` by 1.
     - If `rating[j] > rating[i]`, increment `larger[i]` by 1.
   - Iterate through all soldiers with index `k > i`:
     - If `rating[k] < rating[i]`, increment the `count` by `smaller[i] * larger[k]`.
     - If `rating[k] > rating[i]`, increment the `count` by `larger[i] * smaller[k]`.
4. Return the `count`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numTeams(int[] rating) {
        int n = rating.length;
        int count = 0;
        int[] smaller = new int[n];
        int[] larger = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (rating[j] < rating[i]) {
                    smaller[i]++;
                } else if (rating[j] > rating[i]) {
                    larger[i]++;
                }
            }

            for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if (rating[k] < rating[i]) {
                    count += smaller[i] * larger[k];
                } else if (rating[k] > rating[i]) {
                    count += larger[i] * smaller[k];
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTeams(vector<int>& rating) {
        int n = rating.size();
        int count = 0;
        vector<int> smaller(n, 0);
        vector<int> larger(n, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (rating[j] < rating[i]) {
                    smaller[i]++;
                } else if (rating[j] > rating[i]) {
                    larger[i]++;
                }
            }

            for (int k = i + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if (rating[k] < rating[i]) {
                    count += smaller[i] * larger[k];
                } else if (rating[k] > rating[i]) {
                    count += larger[i] * smaller[k];
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numTeams(self, rating: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(rating)
        count = 0
        smaller = [0] * n
        larger = [0] * n

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if rating[j] < rating[i]:
                    smaller[i] += 1
                elif rating[j] > rating[i]:
                    larger[i] += 1

            for k in range(i + 1, n):
                if rating[k] < rating[i]:
                    count += smaller[i] * larger[k]
                elif rating[k] > rating[i]:
                    count += larger[i] * smaller[k]

        return count
