### Explanation:
To construct k palindrome strings using all characters in the input string s, we need to ensure that each character appears even number of times, or at most one character appears an odd number of times. This is because a palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency.

Therefore, we can count the frequency of each character in the input string s. Then, we iterate through the frequency count and check if the number of characters with odd frequency is less than or equal to k. If this condition is satisfied, we can construct k palindrome strings using all characters in s.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the frequency map will have a fixed size of 26 characters for lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String s, int k) {
        if (s.length() < k) return false;
        
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f % 2 == 1) {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return oddCount <= k;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string s, int k) {
        if (s.length() < k) return false;
        
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f % 2 == 1) {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return oddCount <= k;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        if len(s) < k:
            return False
        
        freq = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        odd_count = sum(f % 2 == 1 for f in freq)
        
        return odd_count <= k
```
