## Explanation
To determine if a circle and a rectangle overlap, we need to consider all possible scenarios where the circle and the rectangle intersect. The key idea is to find the closest point on the rectangle to the center of the circle and then check if that point lies within the circle. If it does, then the circle and rectangle overlap.

1. Find the closest point on the rectangle to the center of the circle. This point may be inside the rectangle or on its boundary.
2. Check if the closest point lies within the circle by calculating the distance between the center of the circle and the closest point.

Time complexity: O(1) as we are just performing some mathematical calculations.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkOverlap(int radius, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        int closestX = Math.max(x1, Math.min(xCenter, x2));
        int closestY = Math.max(y1, Math.min(yCenter, y2));
        
        int distanceX = xCenter - closestX;
        int distanceY = yCenter - closestY;
        
        return (distanceX * distanceX + distanceY * distanceY) <= radius * radius;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkOverlap(int radius, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        int closestX = max(x1, min(xCenter, x2));
        int closestY = max(y1, min(yCenter, y2));
        
        int distanceX = xCenter - closestX;
        int distanceY = yCenter - closestY;
        
        return (distanceX * distanceX + distanceY * distanceY) <= radius * radius;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def checkOverlap(self, radius: int, xCenter: int, yCenter: int, x1: int, y1: int, x2: int, y2: int) -> bool:
        closestX = max(x1, min(xCenter, x2))
        closestY = max(y1, min(yCenter, y2))
        
        distanceX = xCenter - closestX
        distanceY = yCenter - closestY
        
        return (distanceX * distanceX + distanceY * distanceY) <= radius * radius
