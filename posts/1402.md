## Explanation:
To maximize the sum of like-time coefficients, we need to sort the satisfaction levels in descending order and then calculate the like-time coefficient for each dish starting from the highest satisfaction level. We keep track of the total sum as we iterate through the sorted satisfaction levels. If at any point the total sum becomes negative, we stop since discarding any dish after that point will only decrease the total sum.

Algorithm:
1. Sort the satisfaction levels in descending order.
2. Initialize variables `currSum`, `maxSum`, and `totalSum` to 0.
3. Iterate through the sorted satisfaction levels:
   - Update `currSum` by adding the current satisfaction level multiplied by its position in the sorted array.
   - Update `totalSum` by adding `currSum` to the total sum.
   - Update `maxSum` to be the maximum of `maxSum` and `totalSum`.
   - If `currSum` becomes negative at any point, break the loop.
4. Return `maxSum`.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) - Sorting the array
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space is used

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfaction(int[] satisfaction) {
        Arrays.sort(satisfaction);
        int currSum = 0, maxSum = 0, totalSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = satisfaction.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            currSum += satisfaction[i];
            totalSum += currSum;
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, totalSum);
            if (currSum < 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfaction(vector<int>& satisfaction) {
        sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end(), greater<int>());
        int currSum = 0, maxSum = 0, totalSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < satisfaction.size(); i++) {
            currSum += satisfaction[i];
            totalSum += currSum;
            maxSum = max(maxSum, totalSum);
            if (currSum < 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)
        currSum, maxSum, totalSum = 0, 0, 0
        
        for i in range(len(satisfaction)):
            currSum += satisfaction[i]
            totalSum += currSum
            maxSum = max(maxSum, totalSum)
            if currSum < 0:
                break
        
        return maxSum
```
