### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the binary string from right to left. If the current bit is '0', we perform a division operation by 2. If the current bit is '1', we increment the number by 1 and then perform a division operation by 2. We keep track of the number of steps taken until the number becomes 1.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the binary string s.
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSteps(String s) {
        int steps = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            steps++;
            if (s.charAt(i) - '0' + carry == 1) {
                carry = 1;
                steps++;
            }
        }
        
        return steps + carry;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(string s) {
        int steps = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            steps++;
            if (s[i] - '0' + carry == 1) {
                carry = 1;
                steps++;
            }
        }
        
        return steps + carry;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numSteps(self, s: str) -> int:
        steps = 0
        carry = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, 0, -1):
            steps += 1
            if int(s[i]) + carry == 1:
                carry = 1
                steps += 1
        
        return steps + carry
```
