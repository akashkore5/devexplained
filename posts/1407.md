## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by each user and then order the users based on their total distance traveled. If two or more users have traveled the same distance, we need to order them by their name in ascending order.

We can achieve this by joining the Users and Rides tables on the user_id column, grouping by the user's name, and summing the distances traveled by each user. Finally, we can order the result by the total distance in descending order and the name in ascending order.

**Algorithm:**
1. Join the Users and Rides tables on user_id.
2. Group by the user's name and calculate the sum of distances traveled by each user.
3. Order the result by total distance in descending order and the name in ascending order.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of rows in the Rides table.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Rides table.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT u.name, COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, u.name ASC;
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT u.name, COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, u.name ASC;
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT u.name, COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, u.name ASC;
```
