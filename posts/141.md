### Explanation
To determine if a linked list has a cycle, we can use the "fast and slow pointers" approach. We initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (null) before the slow pointer.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using only two extra pointers.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
                return false;
            }
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;
        
        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == nullptr || fast->next == nullptr) {
                return false;
            }
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        return True
```
