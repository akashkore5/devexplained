### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can maintain three states for each column of the grid: color1, color2, and color3 representing the ways to paint the current column with each color. At each step, we can update the states based on the previous column's states and the constraints given in the problem.

Let's define the following transitions:
- color1 for the current column can be painted with color1, color2, or color3 from the previous column, as long as they are different.
- color2 for the current column can be painted with color1 or color3 from the previous column.
- color3 for the current column can be painted with color1 or color2 from the previous column.

The final answer will be the sum of the states of color1, color2, and color3 in the last column.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfWays(int n) {
        long mod = 1000000007;
        long color1 = 6, color2 = 6, color3 = 6;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            long newColor1 = (2 * color1 + 2 * color2) % mod;
            long newColor2 = (2 * color1 + 3 * color2) % mod;
            long newColor3 = (2 * color1 + 2 * color3) % mod;
            
            color1 = newColor1;
            color2 = newColor2;
            color3 = newColor3;
        }
        
        return (int)((color1 + color2 + color3) % mod);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        long mod = 1000000007;
        long color1 = 6, color2 = 6, color3 = 6;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            long newColor1 = (2 * color1 + 2 * color2) % mod;
            long newColor2 = (2 * color1 + 3 * color2) % mod;
            long newColor3 = (2 * color1 + 2 * color3) % mod;
            
            color1 = newColor1;
            color2 = newColor2;
            color3 = newColor3;
        }
        
        return (int)((color1 + color2 + color3) % mod);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        mod = 1000000007
        color1, color2, color3 = 6, 6, 6
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            newColor1 = (2 * color1 + 2 * color2) % mod
            newColor2 = (2 * color1 + 3 * color2) % mod
            newColor3 = (2 * color1 + 2 * color3) % mod
            
            color1, color2, color3 = newColor1, newColor2, newColor3
            
        return int((color1 + color2 + color3) % mod)
