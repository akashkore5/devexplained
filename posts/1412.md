## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the students who always have a lower score than all of their immediate neighbors in all exams. We can iterate over the students and exams, comparing each student's scores with their neighbors to find the quiet students.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Iterate over each student.
2. For each student, compare their scores with the scores of the students before and after them.
3. If the student's score is lower than both neighbors' scores for all exams, add the student to the list of quiet students.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of students and m is the number of exams.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of quiet students.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> quietStudents(int[][] exams) {
        List<Integer> quietStudents = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = exams.length;
        int m = exams[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean isQuiet = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if ((i > 0 && exams[i][j] >= exams[i - 1][j]) ||
                    (i < n - 1 && exams[i][j] >= exams[i + 1][j])) {
                    isQuiet = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isQuiet) {
                quietStudents.add(i);
            }
        }

        return quietStudents;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> quietStudents(vector<vector<int>>& exams) {
        vector<int> quietStudents;
        int n = exams.size();
        int m = exams[0].size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            bool isQuiet = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if ((i > 0 && exams[i][j] >= exams[i - 1][j]) ||
                    (i < n - 1 && exams[i][j] >= exams[i + 1][j])) {
                    isQuiet = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isQuiet) {
                quietStudents.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        return quietStudents;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def quietStudents(self, exams: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        quiet_students = []
        n = len(exams)
        m = len(exams[0])

        for i in range(n):
            is_quiet = True
            for j in range(m):
                if (i > 0 and exams[i][j] >= exams[i - 1][j]) or \
                   (i < n - 1 and exams[i][j] >= exams[i + 1][j]):
                    is_quiet = False
                    break
            if is_quiet:
                quiet_students.append(i)

        return quiet_students
```
