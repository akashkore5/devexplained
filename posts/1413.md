### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum positive value for `startValue` such that the cumulative sum of `startValue` and the elements of the array `nums` is never less than 1. We can achieve this by iterating over the array from left to right, keeping track of the cumulative sum and updating the minimum `startValue` as needed. The algorithm involves calculating the cumulative sum and adjusting the `startValue` until the cumulative sum is always positive.

1. Initialize `startValue` as 1.
2. Iterate over the array `nums` from left to right.
3. Update the cumulative sum by adding the current element of `nums`.
4. If the cumulative sum becomes negative, update the `startValue` to ensure the cumulative sum remains positive.
5. Return the updated `startValue` as the minimum positive value.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minStartValue(int[] nums) {
        int startValue = 1;
        int sum = startValue;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (sum < 1) {
                startValue += 1 - sum;
                sum = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return startValue;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minStartValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        int startValue = 1;
        int sum = startValue;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (sum < 1) {
                startValue += 1 - sum;
                sum = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return startValue;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minStartValue(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start_value = 1
        summation = start_value
        
        for num in nums:
            summation += num
            if summation < 1:
                start_value += 1 - summation
                summation = 1
        
        return start_value
```
