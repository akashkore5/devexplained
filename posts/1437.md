### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate over the binary array `nums` and keep track of the last index where we encountered a 1. If we encounter a 1 at index `i`, we check if the distance between the current index `i` and the last index of 1 is less than `k`. If it is, then we return false, as the 1's are not at least `k` places away. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any violations, we return true.

- Initialize a variable `lastIndex` to -1 to keep track of the last index where a 1 was found.
- Iterate over the array `nums`.
- If the current element is 1:
  - If the difference between the current index and `lastIndex` is less than `k`, return false.
  - Update `lastIndex` to the current index.
- If no violations were found, return true.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean kLengthApart(int[] nums, int k) {
        int lastIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                if (lastIndex != -1 && i - lastIndex <= k) {
                    return false;
                }
                lastIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool kLengthApart(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int lastIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                if (lastIndex != -1 && i - lastIndex <= k) {
                    return false;
                }
                lastIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        lastIndex = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 1:
                if lastIndex != -1 and i - lastIndex <= k:
                    return False
                lastIndex = i
        return True
```
