### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and keep track of the current character and the count of consecutive occurrences of that character. We update the maximum power whenever we encounter a new character or the count of consecutive occurrences increases. Finally, we return the maximum power as the result.

- Initialize variables `maxPower`, `currPower`, `prevChar` to 1.
- Iterate through the string starting from the second character.
- If the current character is the same as the previous character, increment `currPower`.
- If the current character is different, update `maxPower` if `currPower` is greater and reset `currPower`.
- Return `maxPower` as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPower(String s) {
        int maxPower = 1;
        int currPower = 1;
        char prevChar = s.charAt(0);

        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == prevChar) {
                currPower++;
            } else {
                maxPower = Math.max(maxPower, currPower);
                currPower = 1;
                prevChar = s.charAt(i);
            }
        }

        return Math.max(maxPower, currPower);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPower(string s) {
        int maxPower = 1;
        int currPower = 1;
        char prevChar = s[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == prevChar) {
                currPower++;
            } else {
                maxPower = max(maxPower, currPower);
                currPower = 1;
                prevChar = s[i];
            }
        }

        return max(maxPower, currPower);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        maxPower = 1
        currPower = 1
        prevChar = s[0]

        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == prevChar:
                currPower += 1
            else:
                maxPower = max(maxPower, currPower)
                currPower = 1
                prevChar = s[i]

        return max(maxPower, currPower)
```
