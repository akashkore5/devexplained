## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the words in the sentence based on their lengths in increasing order. If two words have the same length, we need to maintain their original order. The approach involves splitting the sentence into words, sorting the words based on their lengths, and then joining them back into a new sentence.

1. Split the given sentence into words.
2. Create a custom comparator to sort the words based on their lengths.
3. Sort the words using the custom comparator.
4. Join the sorted words to form the rearranged sentence.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of words in the sentence.
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of words in the sentence.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String arrangeWords(String text) {
        String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(" ");
        Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());
        
        String result = String.join(" ", words);
        return Character.toUpperCase(result.charAt(0)) + result.substring(1);
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string arrangeWords(string text) {
        vector<string> words;
        string word = "";
        for (char c : text) {
            if (c == ' ') {
                words.push_back(word);
                word = "";
            } else {
                word += tolower(c);
            }
        }
        words.push_back(word);
        
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b){
            if (a.length() == b.length()) {
                return false;
            }
            return a.length() < b.length();
        });
        
        string result = "";
        for (string w : words) {
            result += w + " ";
        }
        result[0] = toupper(result[0]);
        
        return result.substr(0, result.size() - 1);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeWords(self, text: str) -> str:
        words = text.lower().split()
        words.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))
        
        result = " ".join(words)
        return result[0].upper() + result[1:]
```
