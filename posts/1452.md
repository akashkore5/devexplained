### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate over each person's list of favorite companies and check if it is a subset of any other person's list. We can do this by comparing each person's list with all other lists. If a person's list is not a subset of any other list, we add that person's index to the result.

- Create a set for each person's list of favorite companies.
- Iterate over each person's list and compare it with all other lists.
- If a person's list is a subset of any other list, mark that person's index.
- Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list.

Time Complexity: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of people and m is the average length of a list of favorite companies.
Space Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of people and m is the average length of a list of favorite companies.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> peopleIndexes(List<List<String>> favoriteCompanies) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<String>[] sets = new HashSet[favoriteCompanies.size()];

        for (int i = 0; i < favoriteCompanies.size(); i++) {
            sets[i] = new HashSet<>(favoriteCompanies.get(i));
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < favoriteCompanies.size(); i++) {
            boolean isSubset = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < favoriteCompanies.size(); j++) {
                if (i != j && sets[j].containsAll(sets[i])) {
                    isSubset = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isSubset) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> peopleIndexes(vector<vector<string>>& favoriteCompanies) {
        vector<int> result;
        vector<unordered_set<string>> sets(favoriteCompanies.size());

        for (int i = 0; i < favoriteCompanies.size(); i++) {
            sets[i] = unordered_set(favoriteCompanies[i].begin(), favoriteCompanies[i].end());
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < favoriteCompanies.size(); i++) {
            bool isSubset = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < favoriteCompanies.size(); j++) {
                if (i != j && includes(sets[j].begin(), sets[j].end(), sets[i].begin(), sets[i].end())) {
                    isSubset = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isSubset) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def peopleIndexes(self, favoriteCompanies: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        sets = [set(companies) for companies in favoriteCompanies]

        for i in range(len(favoriteCompanies)):
            is_subset = False
            for j in range(len(favoriteCompanies)):
                if i != j and sets[j].issuperset(sets[i]):
                    is_subset = True
                    break
            if not is_subset:
                result.append(i)

        return result
