### Explanation
To solve this problem, we will split the sentence into words and check if the searchWord is a prefix of any word in the sentence. We can achieve this by iterating through each word in the sentence, checking if the word starts with the searchWord. If a match is found, we return the index of that word.

- Split the sentence into words.
- Iterate through each word and check if it starts with the searchWord.
- Return the index of the word if a match is found, else return -1.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of words in the sentence.
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are not using any extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int isPrefixOfWord(String sentence, String searchWord) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].startsWith(searchWord)) {
                return i + 1; // 1-indexed
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int isPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord) {
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string word;
        int index = 1;
        
        while (ss >> word) {
            if (word.find(searchWord) == 0) {
                return index;
            }
            index++;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int:
        words = sentence.split()
        
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if word.startswith(searchWord):
                return i + 1
        
        return -1
```
