### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to first build a directed graph representing the prerequisites of courses. Then, we can use a transitive closure algorithm to determine if one course is a prerequisite of another. Finally, we check each query against the transitive closure matrix to get the answers.

1. Build a directed graph from the prerequisites array.
2. Use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the transitive closure of the graph.
3. Check each query against the transitive closure matrix to get the answers.

Time Complexity: O(n^3) where n is the number of courses.  
Space Complexity: O(n^2) for the transitive closure matrix.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> checkIfPrerequisite(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites, int[][] queries) {
        boolean[][] graph = new boolean[numCourses][numCourses];
        
        for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
            graph[pre[0]][pre[1]] = true;
        }
        
        for (int k = 0; k < numCourses; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < numCourses; j++) {
                    if (graph[i][k] && graph[k][j]) {
                        graph[i][j] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            result.add(graph[query[0]][query[1]]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp

public:
    vector<bool> checkIfPrerequisite(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<vector<bool>> graph(numCourses, vector<bool>(numCourses, false));
        
        for (auto& pre : prerequisites) {
            graph[pre[0]][pre[1]] = true;
        }
        
        for (int k = 0; k < numCourses; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < numCourses; j++) {
                    if (graph[i][k] && graph[k][j]) {
                        graph[i][j] = true;
                    }
                }
            }

        for (auto& query : queries) {
            result.push_back(graph[query[0]][query[1]]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
