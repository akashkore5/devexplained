### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the capital city (city 0) and iteratively change the directions of the edges so that all cities connect to city 0. We need to count the number of edges that need to be changed.

1. Initialize a graph to represent the connections between cities.
2. Perform a DFS starting from city 0 and keep track of the edges that need to be changed.
3. For each edge, if it is currently pointing towards city 0, we mark it as an edge that needs to be changed.
4. Recursively visit neighboring cities and update the count of edges that need to be changed.
5. Finally, return the count of edges that need to be changed.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of cities.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the graph and recursion stack.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] connection : connections) {
            graph.get(connection[0]).add(connection[1]);
            graph.get(connection[1]).add(-connection[0]); // Marking reverse edge
        }
        return dfs(0, -1, graph);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int current, int parent, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(current)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            count += neighbor > 0 ? 1 : 0; // Check if edge needs to be changed
            count += dfs(Math.abs(neighbor), current, graph);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minReorder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        for (const auto& connection : connections) {
            graph[connection[0]].push_back(connection[1]);
            graph[connection[1]].push_back(-connection[0]); // Marking reverse edge
        }
        return dfs(0, -1, graph);
    }
    
    int dfs(int current, int parent, vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int neighbor : graph[current]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            count += neighbor > 0 ? 1 : 0; // Check if edge needs to be changed
            count += dfs(abs(neighbor), current, graph);
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for connection in connections:
            graph[connection[0]].append(connection[1])
            graph[connection[1]].append(-connection[0])  # Marking reverse edge
        
        return self.dfs(0, -1, graph)
    
    def dfs(self, current, parent, graph):
        count = 0
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue
            count += 1 if neighbor > 0 else 0  # Check if edge needs to be changed
            count += self.dfs(abs(neighbor), current, graph)
        return count
