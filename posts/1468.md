### Explanation
Given a list of salaries, you are tasked with calculating the sum of salaries after applying a special tax deduction rule. The rule states that if an employee's salary is higher than the average salary of all employees, their salary will be reduced by a certain percentage.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Calculate the average salary of all employees.
2. Iterate through the list of salaries and for each salary:
   - If the salary is higher than the average salary, reduce it by the given percentage.
   - Add the adjusted salary to the total sum.
3. Return the total sum as the final result.

**Time Complexity:**
- Calculating the average salary: O(n)
- Iterating through the list of salaries: O(n)
Overall time complexity: O(n)

**Space Complexity:**
- We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.
Overall space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public double calculateSalaries(int[] salaries, double percentage) {
        double sum = 0;
        double avgSalary = 0;
        
        // Calculate average salary
        for (int salary : salaries) {
            avgSalary += salary;
        }
        avgSalary /= salaries.length;
        
        // Calculate sum after deduction
        for (int salary : salaries) {
            if (salary > avgSalary) {
                sum += salary - (salary * percentage);
            } else {
                sum += salary;
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double calculateSalaries(vector<int>& salaries, double percentage) {
        double sum = 0;
        double avgSalary = 0;
        
        // Calculate average salary
        for (int salary : salaries) {
            avgSalary += salary;
        }
        avgSalary /= salaries.size();
        
        // Calculate sum after deduction
        for (int salary : salaries) {
            if (salary > avgSalary) {
                sum += salary - (salary * percentage);
            } else {
                sum += salary;
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def calculateSalaries(self, salaries: List[int], percentage: float) -> float:
        total_sum = 0
        avg_salary = sum(salaries) / len(salaries)
        
        for salary in salaries:
            if salary > avg_salary:
                total_sum += salary - (salary * percentage)
            else:
                total_sum += salary
        
        return total_sum
