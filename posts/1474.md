### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the linked list and skip `M` nodes, then delete the next `N` nodes. We need to be careful to handle edge cases where the list may not have enough nodes to delete.

1. Initialize a pointer `current` to the head of the linked list.
2. Iterate through the list, skipping `M` nodes and deleting the next `N` nodes until the end of the list is reached.
3. Ensure to update the next pointers appropriately to connect the nodes after deletion.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space Complexity: O(1)
