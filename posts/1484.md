### Explanation:
- We can solve this problem using SQL queries.
- We need to group the data by sell_date, then count the number of different products sold for each date, and concatenate the product names sorted lexicographically.
- We can achieve this using GROUP BY, COUNT, and GROUP_CONCAT functions in SQL.

:

#### SQL:
```sql
SELECT sell_date, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold, 
       GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product) AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
``````java
// This problem can be solved using SQL query
// Therefore, no Java solution is necessary
```

#### C++:
```cpp
// This problem can be solved using SQL query
// Therefore, no C++ solution is necessary
```

#### Python:
```python
# This problem can be solved using SQL query
# Therefore, no Python solution is necessary
