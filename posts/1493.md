## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the binary array and keep track of the lengths of consecutive sequences of 1's. When we encounter a single 0, we can calculate the length of the combined sequence if we were to remove that 0. We need to handle different cases of 0's occurring at the start, end, or in the middle of the array. The maximum length we find throughout the iteration will be our answer.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize variables: `countOnes` to count consecutive 1's, `prevCount` to store the previous count, `currCount` for the current count, and `maxLen` to store the maximum length found.
2. Iterate through the binary array:
   - If the current element is 1, increment `currCount`.
   - If the current element is 0:
     - Update `maxLen` with the maximum of `maxLen`, `prevCount + currCount`, and `currCount`.
     - Update `prevCount` with `currCount`.
     - Reset `currCount` to 0.
3. Update `maxLen` with the maximum of `maxLen`, `prevCount + currCount`, and `currCount`.
4. Return `maxLen`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int countOnes = 0;
        int prevCount = 0;
        int currCount = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                currCount++;
            } else {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, prevCount + currCount);
                prevCount = currCount;
                currCount = 0;
            }
        }
        
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, prevCount + currCount);
        
        return maxLen == nums.length ? maxLen - 1 : maxLen;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int countOnes = 0;
        int prevCount = 0;
        int currCount = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                currCount++;
            } else {
                maxLen = max(maxLen, prevCount + currCount);
                prevCount = currCount;
                currCount = 0;
            }
        }
        
        maxLen = max(maxLen, prevCount + currCount);
        
        return maxLen == nums.size() ? maxLen - 1 : maxLen;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        countOnes = 0
        prevCount = 0
        currCount = 0
        maxLen = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                currCount += 1
            else:
                maxLen = max(maxLen, prevCount + currCount)
                prevCount = currCount
                currCount = 0
        
        maxLen = max(maxLen, prevCount + currCount)
        
        return maxLen - 1 if maxLen == len(nums) else maxLen
