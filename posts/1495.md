### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the movies that were streamed by at least two friends in the last month. We can achieve this by using a HashMap to store the count of unique friends who streamed each movie. Then, we iterate through the HashMap and count the movies that were streamed by at least two friends.

- Create a HashMap to store the count of unique friends who streamed each movie.
- Iterate through the streaming history and update the count in the HashMap.
- Iterate through the HashMap and count the movies streamed by at least two friends.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of streaming records  
Space Complexity: O(n) for the HashMap

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int numMoviesViewedLastMonth(List<List<Integer>> movies) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> movieCount = new HashMap<>();
        int result = 0;
        
        for (List<Integer> movie : movies) {
            for (int friend : movie) {
                movieCount.put(friend, movieCount.getOrDefault(friend, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        for (int count : movieCount.values()) {
            if (count >= 2) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numMoviesViewedLastMonth(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& movies) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> movieCount;
        int result = 0;
        
        for (auto& movie : movies) {
            for (int friend : movie) {
                movieCount[friend]++;
            }
        }
        
        for (auto& count : movieCount) {
            if (count.second >= 2) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numMoviesViewedLastMonth(self, movies: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        movie_count = {}
        result = 0
        
        for movie in movies:
            for friend in movie:
                movie_count[friend] = movie_count.get(friend, 0) + 1
        
        for count in movie_count.values():
            if count >= 2:
                result += 1
        
        return result
```
