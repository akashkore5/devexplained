## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces.
2. Split the input string by spaces to extract individual words.
3. Reverse the list of words.
4. Join the reversed words with a single space to form the final result string.

Time complexity analysis:
- Splitting the string into words takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.
- Reversing the list of words takes O(n) time.
- Joining the words back into a string takes O(n) time.
Hence, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(n).

Space complexity analysis:
- The space complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string, as we are storing the split words in a list.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result.append(words[i]);
            if (i > 0) {
                result.append(" ");
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        stringstream ss(s);
        string word;
        vector<string> words;

        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }

        reverse(words.begin(), words.end());

        string result;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            result += words[i];
            if (i < words.size() - 1) {
                result += " ";
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.strip().split()
        words.reverse()
        return ' '.join(words)
```
