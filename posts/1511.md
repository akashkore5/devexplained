## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to count the frequency of each customer's orders in the given order list. We can achieve this by using a HashMap to store the count of orders for each customer. Then, we can iterate through the order list and update the count for each customer.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a HashMap to store the count of orders for each customer.
2. Iterate through the order list.
3. For each order, check if the customer exists in the HashMap.
   - If the customer does not exist, add the customer to the HashMap with a count of 1.
   - If the customer exists, increment the count by 1.
4. After iterating through all orders, return the HashMap containing the frequency of orders for each customer.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of orders in the order list.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n) to store the counts for each customer.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public Map<String, Integer> countCustomerOrders(String[] orders) {
        Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String order : orders) {
            frequencyMap.put(order, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(order, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return frequencyMap;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> countCustomerOrders(std::vector<std::string>& orders) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> frequencyMap;
        
        for (const std::string& order : orders) {
            frequencyMap[order]++;
        }
        
        return frequencyMap;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countCustomerOrders(self, orders: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:
        frequency_map = {}
        
        for order in orders:
            if order in frequency_map:
                frequency_map[order] += 1
            else:
                frequency_map[order] = 1
        
        return frequency_map
```
