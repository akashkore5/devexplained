### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to filter out the users with invalid email addresses based on the given rules. We will iterate through each user's email address and check if it follows the specified format. If the email is valid, we will include it in the result table.

1. Iterate through each user in the Users table.
2. Check if the email address follows the format:
   - The prefix name must start with a letter and can contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'.
   - The domain must be '@leetcode.com'.
3. If the email is valid, add the user to the result table.
4. Return the result table.

Time Complexity: O(n*m), where n is the number of users and m is the average length of an email address.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of valid users.
