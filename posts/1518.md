## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of exchanging empty water bottles for full ones until no more exchanges can be made. We keep track of the total number of water bottles we have consumed during this process.

1. Initialize a variable `total` to store the total number of water bottles consumed.
2. While the number of bottles we have is greater than or equal to the number of bottles required for an exchange:
   - Calculate how many bottles we can exchange and update the total accordingly.
   - Update the number of bottles we have left after the exchange.
3. Return the total number of water bottles consumed.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(numBottles)), and the space complexity is O(1).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int total = numBottles;
        while (numBottles >= numExchange) {
            total += numBottles / numExchange;
            numBottles = numBottles / numExchange + numBottles % numExchange;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int total = numBottles;
        while (numBottles >= numExchange) {
            total += numBottles / numExchange;
            numBottles = numBottles / numExchange + numBottles % numExchange;
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        total = numBottles
        while numBottles >= numExchange:
            total += numBottles // numExchange
            numBottles = numBottles // numExchange + numBottles % numExchange
        return total
```
