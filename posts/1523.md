### Explanation:
To count the number of odd numbers between a given range `[low, high]`, we can simply calculate the count of odd numbers in the entire range `[0, high]` and subtract the count of odd numbers in the range `[0, low-1]`. This gives us the count of odd numbers in the range `[low, high]`.

### Algorithm:
1. Calculate the count of odd numbers in the range `[0, high]` using the formula `(high + 1) / 2`.
2. Calculate the count of odd numbers in the range `[0, low-1]` using the formula `low / 2`.
3. Return the difference of the counts calculated in steps 1 and 2.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as it requires only simple arithmetic operations.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        return (high + 1) / 2 - low / 2;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        return (high + 1) / 2 - low / 2;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        return (high + 1) // 2 - low // 2
```
