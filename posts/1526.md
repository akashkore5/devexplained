## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the target array and maintain a variable `prev` to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far. For each element in the target array, we calculate the difference between the current element and the previous element. If this difference is positive, it means we need to increment the subarray from the previous element to the current element to form the target array.

We add this difference to the total number of operations needed and update the `prev` variable. Finally, we return the total number of operations as the result.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize `prev` as 0 and `operations` as 0.
2. Iterate through the target array.
   - For each element `num`:
     - Calculate the difference `diff` between `num` and `prev`.
     - If `diff` is positive, increment `operations` by `diff`.
     - Update `prev` to `num`.
3. Return `operations` as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the length of the target array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOperations(int[] target) {
        int prev = 0;
        int operations = 0;

        for (int num : target) {
            int diff = num - prev;
            if (diff > 0) {
                operations += diff;
            }
            prev = num;
        }

        return operations;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOperations(vector<int>& target) {
        int prev = 0;
        int operations = 0;

        for (int num : target) {
            int diff = num - prev;
            if (diff > 0) {
                operations += diff;
            }
            prev = num;
        }

        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minNumberOperations(self, target: List[int]) -> int:
        prev = 0
        operations = 0

        for num in target:
            diff = num - prev
            if diff > 0:
                operations += diff
            prev = num

        return operations
```
