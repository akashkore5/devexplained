## Explanation:
- We can use SQL to query the Patients table to find the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes (conditions starting with "DIAB1").
- We can achieve this by using the `LIKE` operator in SQL to match conditions that start with "DIAB1".

:

### SQL
```sql
SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
FROM Patients
WHERE conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'
```

```java
// This problem can be solved using SQL query directly.
// No separate Java code implementation is needed.
```

### C++
```cpp
// This problem can be solved using SQL query directly.
// No separate C++ code implementation is needed.
```

### Python
```python
# This problem can be solved using SQL query directly.
# No separate Python code implementation is needed.
