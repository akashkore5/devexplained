## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate from right to left over the target string. If the current character in the target string is different from the corresponding character in the string `s`, we need to flip the range from the current index to the end of the string.

We start from the right end because if we start from the left and flip a range, it might affect the bits to the right of the current index which we have not processed yet.

After processing all the characters in the target string, we will have the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` equal to the target string.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the target string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from the input strings.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String target) {
        int flips = 0;
        char prev = '0';
        
        for (int i = 0; i < target.length(); i++) {
            if (target.charAt(i) != prev) {
                flips++;
                prev = target.charAt(i);
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string target) {
        int flips = 0;
        char prev = '0';
        
        for (int i = 0; i < target.length(); i++) {
            if (target[i] != prev) {
                flips++;
                prev = target[i];
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, target: str) -> int:
        flips = 0
        prev = '0'
        
        for bit in target:
            if bit != prev:
                flips += 1
                prev = bit
        
        return flips
```
