## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the index of the largest integer in a given array. We can achieve this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the largest value seen so far along with its corresponding index. By comparing each element with the current maximum value, we can update the maximum value and its index accordingly. 

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Initialize variables `maxValue` to store the maximum value and `maxIndex` to store its corresponding index.
2. Iterate through the array and for each element:
   - Compare the element with `maxValue`.
   - If the element is greater than `maxValue`, update `maxValue` and `maxIndex`.
3. Return the `maxIndex` as the index of the largest integer.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxIndex(int[] arr) {
        int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxIndex = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > maxValue) {
                maxValue = arr[i];
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxIndex;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxIndex(vector<int>& arr) {
        int maxValue = INT_MIN;
        int maxIndex = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] > maxValue) {
                maxValue = arr[i];
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxIndex;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxIndex(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        maxValue = float('-inf')
        maxIndex = -1
        
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > maxValue:
                maxValue = arr[i]
                maxIndex = i
        
        return maxIndex
```
