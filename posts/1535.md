### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can simulate the game rounds by iterating over the array and keeping track of the current winner and their win count. We will update the winner and win count after each round based on the comparison of the first two elements of the array. Once a winner has won k consecutive rounds, we return the winner.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize variables `winner` and `winCount` to keep track of the current winner and their win count.
2. Iterate over the array starting from index 1.
3. Compare the first two elements of the array.
4. If the current element is greater than the winner, update the winner and reset the win count to 1.
5. If the current element is equal to the winner, increment the win count.
6. If the win count reaches k, return the winner.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getWinner(int[] arr, int k) {
        int winner = arr[0];
        int winCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > winner) {
                winner = arr[i];
                winCount = 1;
            } else {
                winCount++;
            }
            
            if (winCount == k) {
                return winner;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getWinner(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int winner = arr[0];
        int winCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] > winner) {
                winner = arr[i];
                winCount = 1;
            } else {
                winCount++;
            }
            
            if (winCount == k) {
                return winner;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getWinner(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        winner = arr[0]
        win_count = 0
        
        for num in arr[1:]:
            if num > winner:
                winner = num
                win_count = 1
            else:
                win_count += 1
            
            if win_count == k:
                return winner
        
        return winner
```
