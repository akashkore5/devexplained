## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the given binary grid valid. A grid is valid if all the cells above the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are zeros.

We can observe that each row can be represented as a number by considering the binary representation of the row from right to left. The number of trailing zeros in this representation gives us the number of swaps needed to move the row towards the bottom of the grid. If the number of trailing zeros in a row is less than or equal to the number of rows above it, we can swap that row with one of the rows above to move it down.

We can iterate over the rows, calculate the number of trailing zeros for each row, and check if it is possible to swap the row with any of the rows above it. If not, we return -1 since the grid cannot be made valid.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the size of the grid (number of rows or columns). The space complexity is O(n) to store the trailing zeros for each row.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int[] trailingZeros = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate trailing zeros for each row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0 && grid[i][j] == 0; j--) {
                count++;
            }
            trailingZeros[i] = count;
        }
        
        int swaps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int target = n - 1 - i;
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && trailingZeros[j] < target) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j == n) {
                return -1;
            }
            while (j > i) {
                int temp = trailingZeros[j];
                trailingZeros[j] = trailingZeros[j - 1];
                trailingZeros[j - 1] = temp;
                j--;
                swaps++;
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
}
```

```cpp

        int n = grid.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0 && grid[i][j] == 0; j--) {
                count++;
            }
            trailingZeros[i] = count;
        }
        
        int swaps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int target = n - 1 - i;
            int j = i;
            while (j < n && trailingZeros[j] < target) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j == n) {
                return -1;
            }
            while (j > i) {
                swap(trailingZeros[j], trailingZeros[j - 1]);
                j--;
                swaps++;
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
