## Explanation
To solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity, we can use binary search. We iterate over the array and for each element `arr[i]`, we calculate how many missing numbers are there between `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. Then we use binary search to find the kth missing number.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize variables `left` to 0 and `right` to the last element of the array.
2. While `left` is less than `right`:
   - Calculate the mid element as `(left + right) / 2`.
   - Calculate the number of missing elements between `arr[i-1]` and `mid`.
   - If the count of missing elements is less than `k`, update `left = mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, update `right = mid`.
3. Return `left + k` as the kth missing positive number.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) - where n is the length of the input array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left + k;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.size();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left + k;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(arr)
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left + k
```
