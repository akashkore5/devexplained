### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and check if there are three consecutive odd numbers. We can do this by maintaining a count of consecutive odd numbers encountered so far. If the count reaches 3, we return true. Otherwise, we reset the count if we encounter an even number. 

- Start by initializing a count variable to 0.
- Iterate through the array elements.
- If the current element is odd, increment the count.
- If the current element is even, reset the count to 0.
- If at any point the count reaches 3, return true.
- If we reach the end of the array without finding three consecutive odds, return false.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num % 2 != 0) {
                count++;
                if (count == 3) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool threeConsecutiveOdds(vector<int>& arr) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num % 2 != 0) {
                count++;
                if (count == 3) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        count = 0
        for num in arr:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
                if count == 3:
                    return True
            else:
                count = 0
        return False
```
