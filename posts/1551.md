### Explanation
To make all elements of the array equal, we need to perform operations that decrease some elements and increase others. Since we can only subtract 1 from one element and add 1 to another in one operation, the difference between the two elements should be divisible by 2. The target value for all elements will be the middle value in the sorted array. We can calculate the number of operations needed by iterating through the array and calculating the absolute difference between the target value and each element.

- **Algorithmic Idea**:
  1. Calculate the target value by finding the middle element in the sorted array.
  2. Iterate through the array and calculate the total operations needed by summing the absolute differences between the target value and each element.
  3. Return the total operations.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int target = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n / 2) * (n / 2) : ((n / 2) * (n / 2 + 1));
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            operations += Math.abs((2 * i + 1) - target);
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        int target = (n % 2 == 0) ? (n / 2) * (n / 2) : ((n / 2) * (n / 2 + 1));
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            operations += abs((2 * i + 1) - target);
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        target = (n // 2) * ((n + 1) // 2)
        operations = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            operations += abs((2 * i + 1) - target)
        return operations
```
