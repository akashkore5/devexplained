### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the maximum minimum magnetic force between any two balls by trying different minimum magnetic forces using binary search.

1. First, we sort the positions of the baskets.
2. We initialize the `left` and `right` bounds for our binary search. The `left` bound is 1 (minimum possible magnetic force) and the `right` bound is the maximum possible magnetic force which is the distance between the first and last position in the sorted array.
3. In each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the mid value between `left` and `right`, which represents our current minimum magnetic force guess.
4. We then try to place the balls in such a way that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is at least the mid value. If we can successfully place all the balls, we update our answer with the mid value and move our `left` bound to mid + 1.
5. If we cannot place all the balls with the current mid value, it means the force is too high, so we move our `right` bound to mid - 1.
6. We continue this process until `left` is greater than `right`, at which point we return the answer.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] position, int m) {
        Arrays.sort(position);
        int left = 1;
        int right = position[position.length - 1] - position[0];
        int result = -1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (isValid(position, m, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean isValid(int[] position, int m, int minForce) {
        int count = 1;
        int prev = position[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] - prev >= minForce) {
                count++;
                prev = position[i];
            }
        }
        
        return count >= m;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());
        int left = 1;
        int right = position[position.size() - 1] - position[0];
        int result = -1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (isValid(position, m, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    bool isValid(vector<int>& position, int m, int minForce) {
        int count = 1;
        int prev = position[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); i++) {
            if (position[i] - prev >= minForce) {
                count++;
                prev = position[i];
            }
        }
        
        return count >= m;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, position: List[int], m: int) -> int:
        position.sort()
        left = 1
        right = position[-1] - position[0]
        result = -1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            if self.is_valid(position, m, mid):
                result = mid
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return result
    
    def is_valid(self, position: List[int], m: int, min_force: int) -> bool:
        count = 1
        prev = position[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(position)):
            if position[i] - prev >= min_force:
                count += 1
                prev = position[i]
        
        return count >= m
