## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges. We can iterate from `n` down to 1 while updating the number of days needed to eat each number of oranges based on the three possible operations: eating one orange, eating half of the oranges if divisible by 2, or eating two-thirds of the oranges if divisible by 3. We can store the results in an array and use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

- Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` to store the minimum number of days required to eat `i` oranges.
- Initialize `dp[1] = 1` as it takes 1 day to eat 1 orange.
- Iterate from 2 to `n` and for each `i`, update `dp[i]` based on the three possible operations.
- The final answer will be stored in `dp[n]`.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDays(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1 + Math.min(i % 2 + dp[i / 2], i % 3 + dp[i / 3]);
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDays(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1 + min(i % 2 + dp[i / 2], i % 3 + dp[i / 3]);
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = 1 + min(i % 2 + dp[i // 2], i % 3 + dp[i // 3])
            
        return dp[n]
```
