## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the transactions list and keep track of the balance for each account. We can use a HashMap to store the account balances and then calculate the final balance for each account by considering all the transactions.

1. Initialize a HashMap to store the balance of each account.
2. Iterate through the transactions list:
   - Update the balance for the "sender" account by subtracting the transaction amount.
   - Update the balance for the "receiver" account by adding the transaction amount.
3. After processing all transactions, iterate through the HashMap to construct the final summary.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of transactions.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of unique accounts.

:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public Map<Integer, Integer> bankAccountSummary(List<List<Integer>> transactions) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> balances = new HashMap<>();
    
    for (List<Integer> transaction : transactions) {
        int sender = transaction.get(0);
        int receiver = transaction.get(1);
        int amount = transaction.get(2);
        
        balances.put(sender, balances.getOrDefault(sender, 0) - amount);
        balances.put(receiver, balances.getOrDefault(receiver, 0) + amount);
    }
    
    return balances;
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

std::unordered_map<int, int> bankAccountSummary(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& transactions) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> balances;
    
    for (const auto& transaction : transactions) {
        int sender = transaction[0];
        int receiver = transaction[1];
        int amount = transaction[2];
        
        balances[sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
    }
    
    return balances;
}
```

```python
def bankAccountSummary(transactions):
    balances = {}
    
    for transaction in transactions:
        sender, receiver, amount = transaction
        
        balances[sender] = balances.get(sender, 0) - amount
        balances[receiver] = balances.get(receiver, 0) + amount
    
    return balances
```
