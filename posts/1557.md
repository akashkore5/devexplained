## Explanation
To find the minimum number of vertices to reach all nodes in a directed acyclic graph, we can identify the vertices that have no incoming edges. These vertices are guaranteed to be able to reach all other vertices in the graph. Therefore, we can simply iterate through all the edges and mark the destination vertices. Finally, we return the vertices that were not marked.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a set to store all vertices.
2. Iterate through all edges and mark the destination vertices.
3. Iterate through all vertices and add the ones that were not marked to the result set.
4. Return the result set as the answer.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n + E), where n is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of vertices.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, List<List<Integer>> edges) {
        Set<Integer> reachable = new HashSet<>();
        for (List<Integer> edge : edges) {
            reachable.add(edge.get(1));
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!reachable.contains(i)) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        unordered_set<int> reachable;
        for (vector<int>& edge : edges) {
            reachable.insert(edge[1]);
        }
        
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (reachable.find(i) == reachable.end()) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findSmallestSetOfVertices(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        reachable = set()
        for edge in edges:
            reachable.add(edge[1])
        
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in reachable:
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
