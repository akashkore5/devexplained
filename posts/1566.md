### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible patterns of length `m` in the `arr`. For each pattern, we check if it is repeated `k` or more times consecutively in the array. If we find such a pattern, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

- We need to iterate through all possible patterns of length `m`, which will take `O(n)` time.
- For each pattern, we need to check if it is repeated `k` or more times, which will also take `O(n)` time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`.

The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)` as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsPattern(int[] arr, int m, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i + m * k <= n; i++) {
            boolean foundPattern = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                for (int rep = 1; rep < k; rep++) {
                    if (arr[i + j] != arr[i + j + rep * m]) {
                        foundPattern = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!foundPattern) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (foundPattern) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsPattern(vector<int>& arr, int m, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i + m * k <= n; i++) {
            bool foundPattern = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                for (int rep = 1; rep < k; rep++) {
                    if (arr[i + j] != arr[i + j + rep * m]) {
                        foundPattern = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!foundPattern) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (foundPattern) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def containsPattern(self, arr: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> bool:
        n = len(arr)
        
        for i in range(n - m * k + 1):
            found_pattern = True
            for j in range(m):
                for rep in range(1, k):
                    if arr[i + j] != arr[i + j + rep * m]:
                        found_pattern = False
                        break
                if not found_pattern:
                    break
            if found_pattern:
                return True
        
        return False
