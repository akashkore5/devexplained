## Explanation:

In this problem, we are given a method `read4` that reads 4 characters from a file and returns the number of characters read. Our task is to implement a method `read` that reads `n` characters from the file using the `read4` method.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a buffer `buf` to store the characters read.
2. Loop until either `n` characters have been read or the end of the file is reached:
   - Read 4 characters using the `read4` method.
   - Copy the characters read from `read4` to `buf`.
   - Update the total characters read.
3. Return the minimum of `n` and the total characters read.

Time Complexity: O(n) - We read `n` characters from the file.
Space Complexity: O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

:
```java
public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        char[] temp = new char[4];
        int total = 0;
        while (total < n) {
            int count = read4(temp);
            for (int i = 0; i < count && total < n; i++) {
                buf[total++] = temp[i];
            }
            if (count < 4) break;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
// Forward declaration of the read4 API.
int read4(char *buf);

class Solution : public Reader4 {
public:
    int read(char *buf, int n) {
        char temp[4];
        int total = 0;
        while (total < n) {
            int count = read4(temp);
            for (int i = 0; i < count && total < n; i++) {
                buf[total++] = temp[i];
            }
            if (count < 4) break;
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def read(self, buf: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        temp = [""] * 4
        while total < n:
            count = read4(temp)
            for i in range(count):
                if total == n:
                    break
                buf[total] = temp[i]
                total += 1
            if count < 4:
                break
        return total
```
