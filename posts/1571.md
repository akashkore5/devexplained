## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the given array. 

1. We can achieve this by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the difference between the last element (maximum) and the first element (minimum).
2. Another approach is to iterate through the array to find the maximum and minimum values, and then calculate the difference between them.

:
:
```java
public int maxWarehouseManager(int[] items) {
    Arrays.sort(items);
    return items[items.length - 1] - items[0];
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxWarehouseManager(vector<int>& items) {
    sort(items.begin(), items.end());
    return items[items.size() - 1] - items[0];
}
```

### Python:
```python
def maxWarehouseManager(items):
    items.sort()
    return items[-1] - items[0]
```
