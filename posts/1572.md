## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the elements of the given square matrix and calculate the sum of the primary diagonal and the secondary diagonal excluding the overlapping element. We can achieve this by maintaining two pointers for the primary diagonal and the secondary diagonal. We iterate through the matrix and update the sum based on the current element's position.

- For the primary diagonal, the indices of the elements are when `i == j`.
- For the secondary diagonal, the indices of the elements are when `i + j == n - 1`, where `n` is the size of the matrix.

After calculating the sum of both diagonals, we return the total sum as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the matrix.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int diagonalSum(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += mat[i][i]; // primary diagonal
            sum += mat[i][n - 1 - i]; // secondary diagonal
        }
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            sum -= mat[n/2][n/2]; // Exclude the middle element if the matrix has an odd size
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int diagonalSum(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int n = mat.size();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += mat[i][i]; // primary diagonal
            sum += mat[i][n - 1 - i]; // secondary diagonal
        }
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            sum -= mat[n/2][n/2]; // Exclude the middle element if the matrix has an odd size
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def diagonalSum(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(mat)
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total_sum += mat[i][i]  # primary diagonal
            total_sum += mat[i][n - 1 - i]  # secondary diagonal
        if n % 2 == 1:
            total_sum -= mat[n // 2][n // 2]  # Exclude the middle element if the matrix has an odd size
        return total_sum
```
