### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to implement a method `int read(char[] buf, int n)` that reads data from a file using the `read4` API multiple times. The `read4` API reads 4 characters at a time and returns the number of characters read. The `read` method should return the total number of characters read.

We can maintain an internal buffer to store the characters read by `read4` but not yet consumed by the `read` method. We use two pointers `bufPtr` and `bufCnt` to keep track of the current position in the buffer and the total number of characters in the buffer respectively.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. If `bufPtr` reaches the end of the buffer, we read more characters from the file using `read4` and refill the buffer.
2. We copy characters from the internal buffer to the output buffer `buf` until either we reach `n` characters or we exhaust all characters in the internal buffer.
3. If we reach the end of the file or `n` characters are read, we return the total number of characters read.

```java
public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    private char[] buffer = new char[4];
    private int bufPtr = 0;
    private int bufCnt = 0;

    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int total = 0;
        boolean eof = false;

        while (!eof && total < n) {
            if (bufPtr == 0) {
                bufCnt = read4(buffer);
            }

            if (bufCnt == 0) {
                eof = true;
            }

            while (total < n && bufPtr < bufCnt) {
                buf[total++] = buffer[bufPtr++];
            }

            if (bufPtr == bufCnt) {
                bufPtr = 0;
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution : public Reader4 {
private:
    char buffer[4];
    int bufPtr = 0;
    int bufCnt = 0;

public:
    int read(char *buf, int n) {
        int total = 0;
        bool eof = false;

        while (!eof && total < n) {
            if (bufPtr == 0) {
                bufCnt = read4(buffer);
            }

            if (bufCnt == 0) {
                eof = true;
            }

            while (total < n && bufPtr < bufCnt) {
                buf[total++] = buffer[bufPtr++];
            }

            if (bufPtr == bufCnt) {
                bufPtr = 0;
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution(Reader4):
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = [''] * 4
        self.bufPtr = 0
        self.bufCnt = 0

    def read(self, buf: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        eof = False

        while not eof and total < n:
            if self.bufPtr == 0:
                self.bufCnt = self.read4(self.buffer)

            if self.bufCnt == 0:
                eof = True

            while total < n and self.bufPtr < self.bufCnt:
                buf[total] = self.buffer[self.bufPtr]
                total += 1
                self.bufPtr += 1

            if self.bufPtr == self.bufCnt:
                self.bufPtr = 0

        return total
```
