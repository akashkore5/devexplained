### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We will sort both the box sizes and the warehouse heights in non-increasing order. Then, we will iterate through the boxes and warehouse from the largest to the smallest, and try to fit as many boxes as possible into the warehouse.

1. Sort the box sizes and warehouse heights in non-increasing order.
2. Initialize pointers `i` for boxes and `j` for warehouse at the 0th index.
3. While both pointers are within bounds, check if the current box can fit in the current warehouse height.
4. If it fits, increment both pointers.
5. If it doesn't fit, only increment the box pointer.
6. Repeat until all boxes are processed.
7. The number of boxes that can fit into the warehouse is the number of times the box pointer is incremented.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the maximum of number of boxes or warehouse heights.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxBoxesInWarehouse(int[] boxes, int[] warehouse) {
        Arrays.sort(boxes);
        Arrays.sort(warehouse);

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (i < boxes.length && j < warehouse.length) {
            if (boxes[i] <= warehouse[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxBoxesInWarehouse(vector<int>& boxes, vector<int>& warehouse) {
        sort(boxes.begin(), boxes.end());
        sort(warehouse.begin(), warehouse.end());

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (i < boxes.size() && j < warehouse.size()) {
            if (boxes[i] <= warehouse[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxBoxesInWarehouse(self, boxes: List[int], warehouse: List[int]) -> int:
        boxes.sort()
        warehouse.sort()

        i, j = 0, 0
        count = 0

        while i < len(boxes) and j < len(warehouse):
            if boxes[i] <= warehouse[j]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return count
```
