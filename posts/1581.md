## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to identify customers who visited the mall but did not make any transactions. We can achieve this by performing a left join between the `Visits` and `Transactions` tables and then filtering out the rows where there is no corresponding transaction.

1. Perform a left join between the `Visits` and `Transactions` tables on the `visit_id` column.
2. Filter out the rows where there is no corresponding transaction (i.e., where `transaction_id` is NULL).
3. Count the number of such occurrences for each `customer_id`.
4. Return the `customer_id` and the count of visits without transactions.

Time complexity: O(n)

SELECT v.customer_id AS customer_id, 
       COUNT(t.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
```

WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
