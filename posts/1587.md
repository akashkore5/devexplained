### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the balance of each user by summing up all the amounts of transactions associated with their account. Then, we filter out users whose balance is greater than 10000 and return their names and balances.

1. Create a HashMap to store the balance of each user.
2. Iterate through the Transactions table, updating the balance for each transaction.
3. Filter out users whose balance is greater than 10000 and return their names and balances.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of transactions.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the balance of each user.
