### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to print the given `targetGrid` using the strange printer with the given constraints. We can do this by analyzing the colors in the grid and their relationships. If a color appears in a rectangle, it must not have been used before in any other rectangle.

We can iterate through the `targetGrid` and keep track of the color rectangles. If we encounter a color that has been used in a different rectangle, it is not possible to print the grid. Otherwise, we continue checking until the end of the grid.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPrintable(int[][] targetGrid) {
        // Java solution code here
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPrintable(vector<vector<int>>& targetGrid) {
        // C++ solution code here
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPrintable(self, targetGrid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # Python solution code here
```
