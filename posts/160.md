## Explanation

To find the intersection point of two linked lists, we can use a two-pointer approach. We start by iterating through both lists simultaneously using two pointers, one for each list. When a pointer reaches the end of a list, we reset it to the head of the other list. This way, the pointers will travel the same distance before reaching the intersection point.

If the lists intersect, the pointers will meet at the intersection node. If the lists do not intersect, both pointers will reach the end simultaneously, indicating no intersection.

This approach has a time complexity of O(m + n) and uses only O(1) additional memory.
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode pA = headA;
        ListNode pB = headB;

        while (pA != pB) {
            pA = pA == null ? headB : pA.next;
            pB = pB == null ? headA : pB.next;
        }

        return pA;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode *pA = headA;
        ListNode *pB = headB;

        while (pA != pB) {
            pA = pA ? pA->next : headB;
            pB = pB ? pB->next : headA;
        }

        return pA;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        pA, pB = headA, headB

        while pA != pB:
            pA = headB if not pA else pA.next
            pB = headA if not pB else pB.next

        return pA
```
