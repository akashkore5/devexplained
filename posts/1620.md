### Explanation:
- We iterate over each integral coordinate within the given bounds and calculate the network quality at that coordinate by summing up the signal qualities from all reachable towers.
- We keep track of the coordinate with the maximum network quality seen so far and return it in the end.

Time Complexity: O(n^3), where n is the maximum value of the coordinates (50 in this case).
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] bestCoordinate(int[][] towers, int radius) {
        int maxQuality = 0;
        int[] bestCoordinate = new int[]{0, 0};
        
        for (int x = 0; x <= 50; x++) {
            for (int y = 0; y <= 50; y++) {
                int quality = 0;
                for (int[] tower : towers) {
                    int dist = (x - tower[0]) * (x - tower[0]) + (y - tower[1]) * (y - tower[1]);
                    if (dist <= radius * radius) {
                        quality += tower[2] / (1 + Math.sqrt(dist));
                    }
                }
                if (quality > maxQuality) {
                    maxQuality = quality;
                    bestCoordinate = new int[]{x, y};
                }
            }
        }
        
        return bestCoordinate;
    }
}
```

                    if (dist <= radius * radius) {
                        quality += tower[2] / (1 + sqrt(dist));
                    }
