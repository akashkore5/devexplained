### Explanation:
1. Calculate the total number of users registered in each contest.
2. Calculate the total number of users in the Users table.
3. Compute the percentage of users registered in each contest.
4. Return the result table sorted by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order by contest_id in ascending order.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of records in the Register table  
Space Complexity: O(n)

SELECT contest_id, 
    ROUND(COUNT(user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Register), 2) AS percentage
FROM Register
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id;
```

```cpp

GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id;
