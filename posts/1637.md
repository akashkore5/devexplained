### Explanation

To find the widest vertical area between two points containing no other points, we need to determine the maximum difference between the x-coordinates of any two points. We can achieve this by sorting the x-coordinates of the points and calculating the maximum difference between consecutive x-coordinates.

1. Sort the points based on their x-coordinates.
2. Calculate the maximum difference between consecutive x-coordinates.
3. Return the maximum difference as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of points. Sorting the points takes O(n log n) time.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the sorted points.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int maxWidth = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
        }
        return maxWidth;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        
        int maxWidth = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            maxWidth = max(maxWidth, points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
        }
        
        return maxWidth;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort()
        maxWidth = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            maxWidth = max(maxWidth, points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0])
        
        return maxWidth
```
