### Explanation:
To make the string balanced, we need to delete characters such that there are no occurrences of "ba" in the string. We can achieve this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of 'a's encountered so far. Whenever we encounter a 'b', we have two choices: either delete the 'b' or delete the last 'a' encountered. We choose the option that minimizes the number of deletions needed.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `aCount` to keep track of the number of 'a's encountered so far.
2. Initialize a variable `deletions` to 0 to keep track of the number of deletions needed.
3. Iterate through the string:
   - If the current character is 'a', increment `aCount`.
   - If the current character is 'b':
     - If there are 'a's encountered before, decrement `aCount` and increment `deletions`.
     - If there are no 'a's encountered before, increment `deletions`.
4. Return the final value of `deletions`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String s) {
        int aCount = 0;
        int deletions = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'a') {
                aCount++;
            } else {
                if (aCount > 0) {
                    aCount--;
                } else {
                    deletions++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        int aCount = 0;
        int deletions = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == 'a') {
                aCount++;
            } else {
                if (aCount > 0) {
                    aCount--;
                } else {
                    deletions++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        aCount = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if c == 'a':
                aCount += 1
            else:
                if aCount > 0:
                    aCount -= 1
                else:
                    deletions += 1
        
        return deletions
```
