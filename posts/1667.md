## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to update the names in the `Users` table so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase. We can achieve this by converting each name to lowercase and then converting the first character to uppercase. We can use string manipulation functions provided by the programming language to accomplish this task.

1. Iterate through each row in the `Users` table.
2. For each name, convert it to lowercase.
3. Convert the first character of the lowercase name to uppercase.
4. Update the name in the table with the modified name.
5. Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of rows in the `Users` table.
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the space required for the output table.
