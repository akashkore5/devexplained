## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sequence and for each character, check if the word is a substring starting from that character. We can keep track of the maximum repeating value of the word in the sequence.

- Start with a counter initialized to 0.
- Iterate through the sequence.
- For each character, check if the word is a substring starting from that character.
- If it is a substring, increment the counter.
- Keep track of the maximum counter value encountered.
- Return the maximum counter value as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n*m) where n is the length of the sequence and m is the length of the word.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxRepeating(String sequence, String word) {
        int maxRepeating = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= sequence.length() - word.length(); i++) {
            int k = 0;
            while (i + k + word.length() <= sequence.length() && sequence.substring(i + k, i + k + word.length()).equals(word)) {
                k++;
            }
            maxRepeating = Math.max(maxRepeating, k);
        }
        return maxRepeating;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxRepeating(string sequence, string word) {
        int maxRepeating = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= sequence.length() - word.length(); i++) {
            int k = 0;
            while (i + k + word.length() <= sequence.length() && sequence.substr(i + k, word.length()) == word) {
                k++;
            }
            maxRepeating = max(maxRepeating, k);
        }
        return maxRepeating;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        max_repeating = 0
        for i in range(len(sequence) - len(word) + 1):
            k = 0
            while i + k + len(word) <= len(sequence) and sequence[i + k:i + k + len(word)] == word:
                k += 1
            max_repeating = max(max_repeating, k)
        return max_repeating
