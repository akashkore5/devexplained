### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the wealth of each customer by summing up the amounts in their bank accounts, and then find the maximum wealth among all customers.

1. Initialize a variable `maxWealth` to store the maximum wealth found so far.
2. Iterate over each customer's account and calculate their wealth by summing up the amounts.
3. Update `maxWealth` if the current customer's wealth is greater.
4. Finally, return `maxWealth` as the result.

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n) where m is the number of customers and n is the number of bank accounts each customer has.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int wealth = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                wealth += accounts[i][j];
            }
            maxWealth = Math.max(maxWealth, wealth);
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.size(); i++) {
            int wealth = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].size(); j++) {
                wealth += accounts[i][j];
            }
            maxWealth = max(maxWealth, wealth);
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumWealth(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        maxWealth = 0
        for account in accounts:
            wealth = sum(account)
            maxWealth = max(maxWealth, wealth)
        return maxWealth
```
