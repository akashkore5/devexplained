### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a monotonic stack to keep track of the most competitive subsequence. We iterate over the input array `nums` and for each element, we check if adding it to the stack would make the stack size exceed `k` or if the current element is smaller than the top of the stack and we can still make a subsequence of length `k`. In such cases, we pop elements from the stack until the conditions are satisfied, and then push the current element onto the stack.

By the end of the iteration, the stack will contain the most competitive subsequence of size `k`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

```java
public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] stack = new int[k];
    int top = -1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (top >= 0 && nums[i] < stack[top] && k - top < n - i) {
            top--;
        }
        if (top < k - 1) {
            stack[++top] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    
    return stack;
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> stack(k);
        int top = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (top >= 0 && nums[i] < stack[top] && k - top < n - i) {
                top--;
            }
            if (top < k - 1) {
                stack[++top] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return vector<int>(stack.begin(), stack.begin() + k);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def mostCompetitive(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            while stack and num < stack[-1] and len(stack) - 1 + len(nums) - i >= k:
                stack.pop()
            if len(stack) < k:
                stack.append(num)
        
        return stack
```
