### Explanation:
To minimize the deviation in the array, we need to manipulate the elements to try to bring them closer together. We can achieve this by performing the given operations - dividing even numbers by 2 and multiplying odd numbers by 2. 

1. We first need to multiply all odd numbers by 2 to ensure that all numbers are even.
2. Then, we need to repeatedly divide the largest number by 2 until we cannot perform any more operations.
3. At each step, we update the minimum deviation whenever the difference between the current maximum and minimum is smaller than the previous minimum deviation.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the array  
Space Complexity: O(n) for the priority queue

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumDeviation(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int minDeviation = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 1) {
                pq.offer(num * 2);
            } else {
                pq.offer(num);
            }
        }
        
        while (true) {
            int max = pq.poll();
            minDeviation = Math.min(minDeviation, max - pq.peek());
            if (max % 2 == 0) {
                pq.offer(max / 2);
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return minDeviation;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeviation(vector<int>& nums) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        int minDeviation = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 1) {
                pq.push(num * 2);
            } else {
                pq.push(num);
            }
        }
        
        while (true) {
            int max = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            minDeviation = min(minDeviation, max - pq.top());
            if (max % 2 == 0) {
                pq.push(max / 2);
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return minDeviation;
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumDeviation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        pq = []
        minDeviation = float('inf')
        
        for num in nums:
            if num % 2 == 1:
                heapq.heappush(pq, -num * 2)
            else:
                heapq.heappush(pq, -num)
        
        while True:
            max_num = -heapq.heappop(pq)
            minDeviation = min(minDeviation, max_num - pq[0])
            if max_num % 2 == 0:
                heapq.heappush(pq, -max_num // 2)
            else:
                break
        
        return minDeviation
