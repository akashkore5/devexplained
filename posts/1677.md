### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total worth of products that have a higher price than the corresponding invoices. We can iterate through the products and invoices arrays simultaneously and compare the prices. If the product price is greater than the invoice price, we add the product's worth to the total sum.

- Initialize a variable `totalWorth` to store the total worth of products over invoices.
- Iterate through the products and invoices arrays simultaneously.
- If the product price is greater than the invoice price, add the product's worth to `totalWorth`.
- Finally, return `totalWorth`.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the products or invoices array.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getWorthOverInvoices(int[] products, int[] invoices) {
        int totalWorth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
            if (products[i] > invoices[i]) {
                totalWorth += products[i];
            }
        }
        return totalWorth;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getWorthOverInvoices(vector<int>& products, vector<int>& invoices) {
        int totalWorth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < products.size(); i++) {
            if (products[i] > invoices[i]) {
                totalWorth += products[i];
            }
        }
        return totalWorth;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getWorthOverInvoices(self, products: List[int], invoices: List[int]) -> int:
        totalWorth = 0
        for i in range(len(products)):
            if products[i] > invoices[i]:
                totalWorth += products[i]
        return totalWorth
```
