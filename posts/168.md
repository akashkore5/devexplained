## Explanation:
To convert a column number to an Excel column title, we can use a simple algorithm by repeatedly dividing the column number by 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet) and converting the remainders to corresponding characters.

1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
2. While the column number is greater than 0:
   - Calculate the remainder of the column number divided by 26.
   - Adjust the remainder to be in the range of 1 to 26.
   - Convert the remainder to the corresponding character ('A' to 'Z') and append it to the result string.
   - Update the column number by subtracting the remainder and dividing by 26.
3. Reverse the result string to get the correct order of characters.
4. Return the result string as the Excel column title.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) where n is the column number, as we are dividing the number by 26 in each iteration.

**Space Complexity:** O(log n) for storing the result string.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while (columnNumber > 0) {
            columnNumber--;
            result.insert(0, (char)('A' + columnNumber % 26));
            columnNumber /= 26;
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {
        string result = "";
        while (columnNumber > 0) {
            columnNumber--;
            result = (char)('A' + columnNumber % 26) + result;
            columnNumber /= 26;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        result = ""
        while columnNumber > 0:
            columnNumber -= 1
            result = chr(ord('A') + columnNumber % 26) + result
            columnNumber //= 26
        return result
```
