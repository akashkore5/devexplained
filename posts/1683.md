### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the tweet_ids of tweets with content length strictly greater than 15. We can achieve this by selecting tweet_ids from the Tweets table where the length of the content is greater than 15.

- Algorithm:
  1. Select tweet_ids where the length of content is greater than 15 from the Tweets table.
  2. Return the result table containing only the tweet_ids of invalid tweets.

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of tweets in the table.
- Space Complexity: O(1) 

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

#### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```
