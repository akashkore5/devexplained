### Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate through each word in the array and check if all characters in the word are present in the `allowed` string. We can do this by creating a set of characters from the `allowed` string for faster lookup. For each word, we iterate through its characters and check if each character is in the set of allowed characters. If all characters in a word are found in the `allowed` set, we increment the count of consistent strings.

- Time complexity: O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length of a word.
- Space complexity: O(1) as the set of allowed characters has a fixed size of 26.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countConsistentStrings(String allowed, String[] words) {
        int count = 0;
        Set<Character> allowedChars = new HashSet<>();
        for (char c : allowed.toCharArray()) {
            allowedChars.add(c);
        }
        
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean consistent = true;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                if (!allowedChars.contains(c)) {
                    consistent = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (consistent) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countConsistentStrings(string allowed, vector<string>& words) {
        int count = 0;
        unordered_set<char> allowedChars;
        for (char c : allowed) {
            allowedChars.insert(c);
        }
        
        for (string word : words) {
            bool consistent = true;
            for (char c : word) {
                if (allowedChars.find(c) == allowedChars.end()) {
                    consistent = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (consistent) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        allowed_chars = set(allowed)
        
        for word in words:
            consistent = True
            for c in word:
                if c not in allowed_chars:
                    consistent = False
                    break
            if consistent:
                count += 1
                
        return count
```
