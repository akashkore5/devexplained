## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through the boxes in order and simulate the process of loading boxes onto the ship and delivering them to the ports. We will keep track of the current number of boxes on the ship, the current total weight on the ship, the current port the ship is at, and the total trips made by the ship.

For each box, we will check if adding it to the ship will exceed the maximum box limit or weight limit. If it does, we will deliver the current boxes on the ship to the current port and update the ship's state accordingly. We will continue this process until all boxes are delivered.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of boxes. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int boxDelivering(int[][] boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
        int trips = 0;
        int currBoxes = 0;
        int currWeight = 0;
        int currPort = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < boxes.length; i++) {
            int[] box = boxes[i];
            int boxPort = box[0];
            int boxWeight = box[1];
            
            if (i > 0 && boxPort != boxes[i - 1][0]) {
                trips++;
            }
            
            if (currBoxes + 1 > maxBoxes || currWeight + boxWeight > maxWeight) {
                trips++;
                currBoxes = 0;
                currWeight = 0;
                i--;
                continue;
            }
            
            currBoxes++;
            currWeight += boxWeight;
            currPort = boxPort;
        }
        
        return trips + 1;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int boxDelivering(vector<vector<int>>& boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
        int trips = 0;
        int currBoxes = 0;
        int currWeight = 0;
        int currPort = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < boxes.size(); i++) {
            int boxPort = boxes[i][0];
            int boxWeight = boxes[i][1];
            
            if (i > 0 && boxPort != boxes[i - 1][0]) {
                trips++;
            }
            
            if (currBoxes + 1 > maxBoxes || currWeight + boxWeight > maxWeight) {
                trips++;
                currBoxes = 0;
                currWeight = 0;
                i--;
                continue;
            }
            
            currBoxes++;
            currWeight += boxWeight;
            currPort = boxPort;
        }
        
        return trips + 1;
    }
};
```
