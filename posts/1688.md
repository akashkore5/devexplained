### Explanation:
- To determine the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided, we need to simulate the tournament based on the given rules.
- We keep track of the total number of matches played in each round and reduce the number of teams until there is only one winner.
- For each round, if the number of teams is even, we divide the teams by 2 and add the matches played to the total count. If the number of teams is odd, we subtract 1 from the number of teams, divide by 2, and add the matches played to the total count.
- We repeat this process until there is only one team left as the winner.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int matches = 0;
        while (n > 1) {
            matches += n / 2;
            n = (n + 1) / 2;
        }
        return matches;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int matches = 0;
        while (n > 1) {
            matches += n / 2;
            n = (n + 1) / 2;
        }
        return matches;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfMatches(self, n: int) -> int:
        matches = 0
        while n > 1:
            matches += n // 2
            n = (n + 1) // 2
        return matches
```
