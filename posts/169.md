## Explanation:
To find the majority element in an array, we can use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. The idea is to cancel out each occurrence of a majority element with all other elements. If there is a majority element in the array, it will be left as the last candidate after all the elements are processed.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `candidate` to store the current candidate for the majority element and a variable `count` to keep track of its frequency.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the count is 0, set the current element as the candidate and increment the count.
   - If the current element is the same as the candidate, increment the count; otherwise, decrement the count.
3. The majority element will be the last remaining candidate.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int candidate = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int candidate = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        candidate = 0
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += 1 if num == candidate else -1
        
        return candidate
```
