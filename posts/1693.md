## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct lead_ids and partner_ids for each unique combination of date_id and make_name. We can achieve this by grouping the data based on date_id and make_name and then counting the distinct lead_ids and partner_ids for each group.

Algorithm:
1. Group the data by date_id and make_name.
2. For each group, count the distinct lead_ids and partner_ids.
3. Return the result in the specified format.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the DailySales table.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the result.
