### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can simulate the calls between two persons and count the number of calls that occur between them. We can maintain a call log for each person and then iterate through the call logs to find the number of calls that overlap.

Steps:
1. Create call logs for both persons to store the start and end times of their calls.
2. Iterate through each call in the first person's call log and check if there are any overlapping calls in the second person's call log.
3. If there is an overlap, calculate the duration of the overlapping calls.
4. Sum up the durations of all overlapping calls to get the total number of calls between the two persons.

Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n and m are the number of calls for each person respectively.
Space Complexity: O(n+m) to store the call logs for both persons.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfCalls(int[][] person1, int[][] person2) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] call1 : person1) {
            for (int[] call2 : person2) {
                int start = Math.max(call1[0], call2[0]);
                int end = Math.min(call1[1], call2[1]);
                if (start < end) {
                    count += end - start;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfCalls(vector<vector<int>>& person1, vector<vector<int>>& person2) {
        int count = 0;
        for (auto& call1 : person1) {
            for (auto& call2 : person2) {
                int start = max(call1[0], call2[0]);
                int end = min(call1[1], call2[1]);
                if (start < end) {
                    count += end - start;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfCalls(self, person1: List[List[int]], person2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for call1 in person1:
            for call2 in person2:
                start = max(call1[0], call2[0])
                end = min(call1[1], call2[1])
                if start < end:
                    count += end - start
        return count
```
