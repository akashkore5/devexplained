### Explanation:
- We can simulate the process of students taking sandwiches by iterating over the students and sandwiches arrays.
- We will keep track of the index of the next sandwich to be taken.
- If a student prefers the current sandwich, they will take it and move to the next sandwich.
- If a student does not prefer the current sandwich, they will be moved to the end of the queue.
- We repeat this process until all students have either taken a sandwich or are unable to eat.
- The number of students unable to eat is the remaining number of students in the queue.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countStudents(int[] students, int[] sandwiches) {
        int[] count = new int[2];
        for (int student : students) {
            count[student]++;
        }
        
        for (int sandwich : sandwiches) {
            if (count[sandwich] == 0) {
                break;
            }
            count[sandwich]--;
        }
        
        return count[0] + count[1];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countStudents(vector<int>& students, vector<int>& sandwiches) {
        vector<int> count(2, 0);
        
        for (int student : students) {
            count[student]++;
        }
        
        for (int sandwich : sandwiches) {
            if (count[sandwich] == 0) {
                break;
            }
            count[sandwich]--;
        }
        
        return count[0] + count[1];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, students: List[int], sandwiches: List[int]) -> int:
        count = [0, 0]
        
        for student in students:
            count[student] += 1
        
        for sandwich in sandwiches:
            if count[sandwich] == 0:
                break
            count[sandwich] -= 1
        
        return count[0] + count[1]
```
