## Explanation

To solve this problem, we iterate through the customers array and maintain the current time and the finish time of the chef's current order. We calculate the waiting time for each customer and update the current time accordingly. Finally, we calculate the average waiting time based on the total waiting time and the number of customers.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables: currentTime = 0, totalWaitTime = 0.
2. Iterate through each customer in the customers array.
3. Calculate the finish time for the current customer as max(currentTime, customer[0]) + customer[1].
4. Calculate the waiting time for the current customer as finish time - customer[0].
5. Update totalWaitTime by adding the waiting time.
6. Update currentTime to the finish time.
7. Calculate the average waiting time as totalWaitTime divided by the number of customers.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of customers.
Space Complexity: O(1).
```java
class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        int n = customers.length;
        int currentTime = 0;
        int totalWaitTime = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int finishTime = Math.max(currentTime, customers[i][0]) + customers[i][1];
            int waitingTime = finishTime - customers[i][0];
            totalWaitTime += waitingTime;
            currentTime = finishTime;
        }
        
        return (double) totalWaitTime / n;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double averageWaitingTime(vector<vector<int>>& customers) {
        int n = customers.size();
        int currentTime = 0;
        int totalWaitTime = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int finishTime = max(currentTime, customers[i][0]) + customers[i][1];
            int waitingTime = finishTime - customers[i][0];
            totalWaitTime += waitingTime;
            currentTime = finishTime;
        }
        
        return (double) totalWaitTime / n;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def averageWaitingTime(self, customers: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        n = len(customers)
        currentTime = 0
        totalWaitTime = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            finishTime = max(currentTime, customers[i][0]) + customers[i][1]
            waitingTime = finishTime - customers[i][0]
            totalWaitTime += waitingTime
            currentTime = finishTime
        
        return totalWaitTime / n
```
