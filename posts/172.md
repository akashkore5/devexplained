### Explanation
To count the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number, we need to count the number of factors of 5 in the factorial. This is because the number of 5s in the prime factorization of a number will determine the number of trailing zeroes in its factorial. We can iteratively divide the number by 5 and sum up the quotients to get the total number of trailing zeroes.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
2. Iterate over the numbers from 5 to n in steps of 5.
3. For each number, divide it by 5 and add the quotient to `count`.
4. Return `count` as the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) since we are dividing the number by 5 in each iteration.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 5; i <= n; i += 5) {
            int num = i;
            while (num % 5 == 0) {
                count++;
                num /= 5;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 5; i <= n; i += 5) {
            int num = i;
            while (num % 5 == 0) {
                count++;
                num /= 5;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(5, n+1, 5):
            num = i
            while num % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
                num //= 5
        return count
```
