### Explanation
To swap the kth node from the beginning with the kth node from the end in a linked list, we can follow these steps:
1. Traverse the linked list to find the kth node from the beginning and store its value.
2. Traverse the linked list again to find the kth node from the end and swap its value with the previously stored value.
3. Return the modified linked list.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy, slow = dummy, first = dummy, second = dummy;
        
        // Move fast k nodes ahead
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        first = fast;
        
        // Move fast to the end and slow will reach kth node from the end
        while (fast != null) {
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        second = slow;
        
        // Swap values
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* swapNodes(ListNode* head, int k) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* fast = dummy;
        ListNode* slow = dummy;
        ListNode* first = dummy;
        ListNode* second = dummy;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        first = fast;
        
        while (fast != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        
        second = slow;
        
        int temp = first->val;
        first->val = second->val;
        second->val = temp;
        
        return head;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        fast = dummy
        slow = dummy
        first = dummy
        second = dummy
        
        for i in range(k):
            fast = fast.next
            
        first = fast
        
        while fast is not None:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        second = slow
        
        temp = first.val
        first.val = second.val
        second.val = temp
        
        return head
```
