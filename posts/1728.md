### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization to simulate the game between the Cat and the Mouse. We will keep track of the positions of the Cat and the Mouse, as well as the number of turns taken. We will explore all possible moves for both the Cat and the Mouse at each step and memorize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

1. We will start the DFS from the current positions of the Cat and the Mouse.
2. At each step, we will consider all possible moves for both the Cat and the Mouse within their jump limits.
3. We will check if the game has ended (Cat wins, Mouse wins, or maximum turns reached).
4. If not, we will recursively call the DFS function for the next positions of the Cat and the Mouse.
5. We will memoize the results to avoid recalculating the same state multiple times.
6. If at any point we find a state where the Mouse can win, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

Time Complexity: O(rows * cols * catJump * mouseJump)
Space Complexity: O(rows * cols * catJump * mouseJump)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canMouseWin(String[] grid, int catJump, int mouseJump) {
        // Java solution
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMouseWin(vector<string>& grid, int catJump, int mouseJump) {
        // C++ solution
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canMouseWin(self, grid: List[str], catJump: int, mouseJump: int) -> bool:
        # Python solution
```

This approach will efficiently determine if the Mouse can win the game given the grid, catJump, and mouseJump values.
