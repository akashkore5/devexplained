## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of boxes that can touch the floor while following the given placement rules. We can approach this by iteratively placing boxes in layers until we reach the total number of boxes. The key observation is that each layer will have one more box than the previous layer until we have placed all boxes.

1. Initialize variables `totalBoxes` and `currLayerBoxes` to 0, and `layer` to 1.
2. Repeat the following steps while `totalBoxes` is less than `n`:
   - Increment `currLayerBoxes` by `layer`.
   - Increment `totalBoxes` by `currLayerBoxes`.
   - Increment `layer` by 1.
3. Return the value of `layer - 1` as this will be the minimum number of boxes touching the floor.

Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        int totalBoxes = 0;
        int currLayerBoxes = 0;
        int layer = 1;
        
        while (totalBoxes < n) {
            currLayerBoxes += layer;
            totalBoxes += currLayerBoxes;
            layer++;
        }
        
        return layer - 1;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        int totalBoxes = 0;
        int currLayerBoxes = 0;
        int layer = 1;
        
        while (totalBoxes < n) {
            currLayerBoxes += layer;
            totalBoxes += currLayerBoxes;
            layer++;
        }
        
        return layer - 1;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumBoxes(self, n: int) -> int:
        totalBoxes = 0
        currLayerBoxes = 0
        layer = 1
        
        while totalBoxes < n:
            currLayerBoxes += layer
            totalBoxes += currLayerBoxes
            layer += 1
        
        return layer - 1
```
