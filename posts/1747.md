## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of banning accounts and counting the number of users who have been banned. We can use a hash set to keep track of banned accounts and their associated users. By iterating through the given account and user arrays, we can check if the account is banned. If the account is not banned, we add it to the hash set and increment the count of banned users. If the account is already banned, we skip it and move on to the next account.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize a hash set to store banned accounts.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the count of banned users.
3. Iterate through the given arrays of accounts and users.
4. Check if the current account is already in the hash set. If not, add it to the hash set and increment the count of banned users.
5. Return the count of banned users.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of accounts/users provided.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of accounts/users provided.

:

```java
public int countBannedUsers(int[] accounts, int[] users) {
    Set<Integer> bannedAccounts = new HashSet<>();
    int bannedUsersCount = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
        if (!bannedAccounts.contains(accounts[i])) {
            bannedAccounts.add(accounts[i]);
            bannedUsersCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return bannedUsersCount;
}
```

```cpp
int countBannedUsers(vector<int>& accounts, vector<int>& users) {
    unordered_set<int> bannedAccounts;
    int bannedUsersCount = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < accounts.size(); i++) {
        if (bannedAccounts.find(accounts[i]) == bannedAccounts.end()) {
            bannedAccounts.insert(accounts[i]);
            bannedUsersCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return bannedUsersCount;
}
```

```python
def countBannedUsers(accounts, users):
    bannedAccounts = set()
    bannedUsersCount = 0
    
    for account in accounts:
        if account not in bannedAccounts:
            bannedAccounts.add(account)
            bannedUsersCount += 1
    
    return bannedUsersCount
```
