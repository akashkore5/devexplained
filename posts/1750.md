### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We start with two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the string. We keep moving these pointers towards each other as long as the characters at these positions are the same. Whenever we find different characters at these positions, we delete the common prefix and suffix and continue the process.

The algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Initialize two pointers, `start` at index 0 and `end` at index `s.length()-1`.
2. While `start < end`, check if `s[start] == s[end]`, if so, increment `start` and decrement `end`.
3. If `s[start] != s[end]`, delete the common prefix and suffix by incrementing `start` and decrementing `end`.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `start >= end`.
5. Return the remaining length of `s`.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length() - 1;
        while (start < end && s.charAt(start) == s.charAt(end)) {
            char common = s.charAt(start);
            while (start <= end && s.charAt(start) == common) start++;
            while (end >= start && s.charAt(end) == common) end--;
        }
        return end - start + 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int start = 0, end = s.length() - 1;
        while (start < end && s[start] == s[end]) {
            char common = s[start];
            while (start <= end && s[start] == common) start++;
            while (end >= start && s[end] == common) end--;
        }
        return end - start + 1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        start, end = 0, len(s) - 1
        while start < end and s[start] == s[end]:
            common = s[start]
            while start <= end and s[start] == common:
                start += 1
            while end >= start and s[end] == common:
                end -= 1
        return end - start + 1
```
