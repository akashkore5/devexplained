### Explanation:
To maximize the score, we need to ensure that we are always picking stones from two of the piles with the most stones. We can achieve this by repeatedly selecting stones from the two largest piles until there are fewer than two non-empty piles left.

1. Sort the input piles in descending order.
2. While there are more than two non-empty piles, pick stones from the first two largest piles and add 1 to the score.
3. Return the final score.

The time complexity of this approach is O(1) because we are dealing with a fixed number of piles. The space complexity is also O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        int[] piles = {a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        
        int score = 0;
        while (piles[1] > 0) {
            piles[2]--;
            piles[1]--;
            Arrays.sort(piles);
            score++;
        }
        
        return score;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        vector<int> piles = {a, b, c};
        sort(piles.begin(), piles.end(), greater<int>());
        
        int score = 0;
        while (piles[1] > 0) {
            piles[2]--;
            piles[1]--;
            sort(piles.begin(), piles.end(), greater<int>());
            score++;
        }
        
        return score;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        piles = [a, b, c]
        piles.sort(reverse=True)
        
        score = 0
        while piles[1] > 0:
            piles[2] -= 1
            piles[1] -= 1
            piles.sort(reverse=True)
            score += 1
        
        return score
```
