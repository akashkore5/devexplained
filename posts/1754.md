### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We compare the current characters of `word1` and `word2`, and choose the larger character to append to the `merge` string. If the characters are equal, we compare the following characters until we find a difference.

We iterate through the strings until one of them becomes empty, and then append the remaining characters of the non-empty string to the `merge` string.
 Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public String largestMerge(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder merge = new StringBuilder();
        while (!word1.isEmpty() && !word2.isEmpty()) {
            if (word1.compareTo(word2) > 0) {
                merge.append(word1.charAt(0));
                word1 = word1.substring(1);
            } else {
                merge.append(word2.charAt(0));
                word2 = word2.substring(1);
            }
        }
        merge.append(word1).append(word2);
        return merge.toString();
    }
}
```

### C++ Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string largestMerge(string word1, string word2) {
        string merge;
        while (!word1.empty() && !word2.empty()) {
            if (word1 > word2) {
                merge += word1[0];
                word1 = word1.substr(1);
            } else {
                merge += word2[0];
                word2 = word2.substr(1);
            }
        }
        merge += word1 + word2;
        return merge;
    }
};
```

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def largestMerge(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        merge = ""
        while word1 and word2:
            if word1 > word2:
                merge += word1[0]
                word1 = word1[1:]
            else:
                merge += word2[0]
                word2 = word2[1:]
        merge += word1 + word2
        return merge
```
