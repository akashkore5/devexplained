### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to query the product_ids of products that are both low fat (low_fats = 'Y') and recyclable (recyclable = 'Y'). We can achieve this by using a simple SQL query with a WHERE clause to filter the rows that satisfy both conditions.

:

```java
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

```cpp
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

```python
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
