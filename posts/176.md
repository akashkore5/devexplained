### Explanation
To find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table, we can use a SQL query that selects the maximum salary that is smaller than the maximum salary in the table. We can achieve this by ordering the salaries in descending order and then skipping the first row.
#### SQL Query
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)

# Not applicable for SQL problem
```

#### C++
```cpp
# Not applicable for SQL problem
```

#### Python
```python
# SQL query can be executed in Python using libraries like SQLAlchemy
# Here is a sample code snippet using SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

# Create engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')

# Insert data into Employee table
with engine.connect() as conn:
    conn.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE Employee (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            salary INTEGER
        )
    ''')
    conn.execute('''
        INSERT INTO Employee (id, salary) VALUES
        (1, 100),
        (2, 200),
        (3, 300)
    ''')

# Execute SQL query
query = '''
    SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
    FROM Employee
    WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee)
'''
result = engine.execute(text(query)).fetchone()

# Print result
if result and result['SecondHighestSalary'] is not None:
    print(result['SecondHighestSalary'])
else:
    print(None)
```
