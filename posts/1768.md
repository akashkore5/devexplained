# Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate over both input strings simultaneously and merge them by adding letters in alternating order. We can keep track of the current index in both strings and append the characters to the result string accordingly. If one string is longer than the other, we can simply append the remaining characters to the result string.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` for `word1` and `word2` respectively.
2. Iterate over both strings and merge them by adding letters in alternating order.
3. If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters to the result string.
4. Return the merged string.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the maximum length of `word1` and `word2`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(n) since we are using a StringBuilder to store the merged string.
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length()) {
                result.append(word1.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }
            if (j < word2.length()) {
                result.append(word2.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string result = "";
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length()) {
                result += word1[i];
                i++;
            }
            if (j < word2.length()) {
                result += word2[j];
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        result = []
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        while i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
            if i < len(word1):
                result.append(word1[i])
                i += 1
            if j < len(word2):
                result.append(word2[j])
                j += 1
        
        return ''.join(result)
```
