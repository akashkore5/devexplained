## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the boxes and calculate the number of operations needed to move balls to each box. For each box, we calculate the total operations needed by iterating through all boxes and accumulating the distances to move balls to the current box. We can optimize this process by pre-calculating the total distances for all boxes to the left and right separately and then summing them up.

- Initialize arrays `prefixSumLeft` and `prefixSumRight` to store the total distances to move balls to the left and right for each box respectively.
- Iterate through the boxes from left to right and calculate the prefix sum of distances to the left for each box.
- Iterate through the boxes from right to left and calculate the prefix sum of distances to the right for each box.
- Finally, iterate through all boxes and calculate the total operations needed for each box by summing the distances to the left and right.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of boxes.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) for storing prefix sums.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] prefixSumLeft = new int[n];
        int[] prefixSumRight = new int[n];
        
        int leftCount = 0, leftOps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSumLeft[i] = leftOps;
            leftCount += boxes.charAt(i) - '0';
            leftOps += leftCount;
        }
        
        int rightCount = 0, rightOps = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            prefixSumRight[i] = rightOps;
            rightCount += boxes.charAt(i) - '0';
            rightOps += rightCount;
        }
        
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] = prefixSumLeft[i] + prefixSumRight[i];
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minOperations(string boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        vector<int> prefixSumLeft(n), prefixSumRight(n);
        
        int leftCount = 0, leftOps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSumLeft[i] = leftOps;
            leftCount += boxes[i] - '0';
            leftOps += leftCount;
        }
        
        int rightCount = 0, rightOps = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            prefixSumRight[i] = rightOps;
            rightCount += boxes[i] - '0';
            rightOps += rightCount;
        }
        
        vector<int> answer(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] = prefixSumLeft[i] + prefixSumRight[i];
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(boxes)
        prefix_sum_left = [0] * n
        prefix_sum_right = [0] * n
        
        left_count, left_ops = 0, 0

            prefix_sum_left[i] = left_ops
            left_count += int(boxes[i])
            left_ops += left_count
        
        right_count, right_ops = 0, 0
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            prefix_sum_right[i] = right_ops
            right_count += int(boxes[i])
            right_ops += right_count
