### Explanation
To find the nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table, we can use a SQL query that selects the distinct salary values in descending order and skips the first n-1 results to get the nth highest salary.

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT DISTINCT salary AS getNthHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT n-1, 1
```

#### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT DISTINCT salary AS getNthHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT n-1, 1
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT DISTINCT salary AS getNthHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT n-1, 1
```
