### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can simulate the car movements and collisions. For each car, we calculate the time it takes to collide with the next car. If a collision occurs, we update the speed of the current car to be the speed of the slower car in the collision. We continue this process until no more collisions can occur. 

We can use a stack to keep track of the cars that have not collided yet. We iterate over the cars from the back (closest to the end of the road) towards the front. For each car, we calculate the time it takes to collide with the next car. If a collision occurs, we update the speed of the current car and pop the next car from the stack. If no collision occurs, we push the current car onto the stack. 

At the end of the simulation, the stack will contain the remaining cars that did not collide with the next car. We iterate over the stack to calculate the collision times for these cars.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of cars.

```java
class Solution {
    public double[] getCollisionTimes(int[][] cars) {
        int n = cars.length;
        double[] ans = new double[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                int j = stack.peek();
                double time = (double)(cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / (double)(cars[i][1] - cars[j][1]);
                if (time <= 0 || time >= ans[j] && ans[j] > 0) {
                    stack.pop();
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                ans[i] = -1.0;
            } else {
                int j = stack.peek();
                ans[i] = (double)(cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / (double)(cars[i][1] - cars[j][1]);
            }
            
            stack.push(i);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> getCollisionTimes(vector<vector<int>>& cars) {
        int n = cars.size();
        vector<double> ans(n, -1.0);
        stack<int> st;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!st.empty()) {
                int j = st.top();
                double time = double(cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / double(cars[i][1] - cars[j][1]);
                if (time <= 0 || (time >= ans[j] && ans[j] > 0)) {
                    st.pop();
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (st.empty()) {
                ans[i] = -1.0;
            } else {
                int j = st.top();
                ans[i] = double(cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / double(cars[i][1] - cars[j][1]);
            }
            
            st.push(i);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getCollisionTimes(self, cars: List[List[int]]) -> List[float]:
        n = len(cars)
        ans = [-1.0] * n
        stack = []
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack:
                j = stack[-1]
                time = (cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / (cars[i][1] - cars[j][1])
                if time <= 0 or (time >= ans[j] and ans[j] > 0):
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    break
            
            if not stack:
                ans[i] = -1.0
            else:
                j = stack[-1]
                ans[i] = (cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / (cars[i][1] - cars[j][1])
            
            stack.append(i)
        
        return ans
