## Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate through each point in the `points` array and calculate the Manhattan distance for each point. We keep track of the minimum distance and the index of the point with the minimum distance that shares the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate with the given location (x, y).

We initialize the minimum distance as infinity and the result index as -1. We then iterate through each point, calculate the Manhattan distance, and update the result index if the current point has a smaller Manhattan distance and shares the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate.

After iterating through all points, we return the result index as the answer.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of points
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, int[][] points) {
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int resultIndex = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            int px = points[i][0];
            int py = points[i][1];
            
            if (px == x || py == y) {
                int distance = Math.abs(px - x) + Math.abs(py - y);
                if (distance < minDistance) {
                    minDistance = distance;
                    resultIndex = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return resultIndex;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        int resultIndex = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int px = points[i][0];
            int py = points[i][1];
            
            if (px == x || py == y) {
                int distance = abs(px - x) + abs(py - y);
                if (distance < minDistance) {
                    minDistance = distance;
                    resultIndex = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return resultIndex;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def nearestValidPoint(self, x: int, y: int, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        minDistance = float('inf')
        resultIndex = -1
        
        for i in range(len(points)):
            px, py = points[i]
            
            if px == x or py == y:
                distance = abs(px - x) + abs(py - y)
                if distance < minDistance:
                    minDistance = distance
                    resultIndex = i
        
        return resultIndex
