### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given array of strings representing the Grand Slam titles. We can use a HashMap to keep track of the count of each player's titles. We will also maintain a separate variable to keep track of the maximum number of titles won by any player. Finally, we will return the list of players who have won the maximum number of titles.

1. Create a HashMap to store the count of titles won by each player.
2. Iterate through the given array and update the count of titles for each player.
3. Keep track of the maximum number of titles won by any player.
4. Iterate through the HashMap to find players with the maximum number of titles.
5. Return the list of players with the maximum number of titles.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of titles.
Space complexity: O(n) for the HashMap.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> grandSlamTitles(String[] titles) {
        Map<String, Integer> playerTitles = new HashMap<>();
        int maxTitles = 0;
        
        for (String title : titles) {
            playerTitles.put(title, playerTitles.getOrDefault(title, 0) + 1);
            maxTitles = Math.max(maxTitles, playerTitles.get(title));
        }
        
        List<String> maxTitlePlayers = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String player : playerTitles.keySet()) {
            if (playerTitles.get(player) == maxTitles) {
                maxTitlePlayers.add(player);
            }
        }
        
        return maxTitlePlayers;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::string> grandSlamTitles(std::vector<std::string>& titles) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> playerTitles;
        int maxTitles = 0;
        
        for (const std::string& title : titles) {
            playerTitles[title]++;
            maxTitles = std::max(maxTitles, playerTitles[title]);
        }
        
        std::vector<std::string> maxTitlePlayers;
        for (const auto& player : playerTitles) {
            if (player.second == maxTitles) {
                maxTitlePlayers.push_back(player.first);
            }
        }
        
        return maxTitlePlayers;
    }
};
```

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def grand_slam_titles(self, titles: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        player_titles = Counter(titles)
        max_titles = max(player_titles.values())
        
        max_title_players = [player for player, count in player_titles.items() if count == max_titles]
        
        return max_title_players
```

These solutions provide a way to find the players with the maximum number of Grand Slam titles won based on the input array of titles.
