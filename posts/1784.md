### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the binary string and check if there is more than one segment of ones. We can maintain a flag to track if we have seen a one and if we see another one, we can set the flag to false. If we encounter a zero after seeing a one, we can reset the flag. If the flag is false and we encounter another one, then there are more than one segment of ones.

- Initialize a boolean flag `foundOne` to false.
- Iterate through the binary string.
- If the current character is '1', check if `foundOne` is already true. If true, return false as there are more than one segment of ones. Otherwise, set `foundOne` to true.
- If the current character is '0' and `foundOne` is true, reset `foundOne` to false.
- If the loop finishes without any issues, return true as there is at most one segment of ones.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkOnesSegment(String s) {
        boolean foundOne = false;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '1') {
                if (foundOne) {
                    return false;
                }
                foundOne = true;
            } else if (foundOne) {
                foundOne = false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkOnesSegment(string s) {
        bool foundOne = false;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '1') {
                if (foundOne) {
                    return false;
                }
                foundOne = true;
            } else if (foundOne) {
                foundOne = false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def checkOnesSegment(self, s: str) -> bool:
        foundOne = False
        for c in s:
            if c == '1':
                if foundOne:
                    return False
                foundOne = True
            elif foundOne:
                foundOne = False
        return True
```
