## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and calculate the total sum of the array. Then, we can find the difference between the goal and the sum of the array. Next, we calculate the number of elements needed to add to reach the goal by dividing the absolute difference by the limit and rounding it up to the nearest integer. 

## Algorithmic Idea:
1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Find the absolute difference between the goal and the sum of the array.
3. Calculate the number of elements needed to add by dividing the absolute difference by the limit and rounding it up.
4. Return the number of elements needed.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array nums.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using only a few extra variables to store intermediate results.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minElements(int[] nums, int limit, int goal) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        long diff = Math.abs((long) goal - sum);
        return (int) ((diff + limit - 1) / limit);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minElements(vector<int>& nums, int limit, int goal) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        long long diff = abs((long long)goal - sum);
        return (diff + limit - 1) / limit;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minElements(self, nums: List[int], limit: int, goal: int) -> int:
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        diff = abs(goal - total_sum)
        return (diff + limit - 1) // limit
```
