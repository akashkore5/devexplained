## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query to filter the Employee table based on the primary_flag column. We will select the employee_id and department_id where primary_flag is 'Y' or where an employee belongs to only one department.

:

### SQL Solution
```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
```
