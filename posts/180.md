### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query that leverages window functions to find consecutive numbers that appear at least three times. We can use the `LAG` and `LEAD` functions to compare the current row with the previous and next rows, respectively. If the current row's `num` value is equal to both the previous and next rows' `num` values, then we have a sequence of at least three consecutive numbers.
#### SQL
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.id = l2.id - 1
    AND l2.id = l3.id - 1
    AND l1.num = l2.num
    AND l2.num = l3.num;
