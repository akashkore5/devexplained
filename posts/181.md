### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to join the `Employee` table with itself based on the `managerId` column to compare the salaries of employees with their managers. We can achieve this by using a self-join query. If an employee's salary is greater than their manager's salary, we include that employee in the result.

### Algorithm:
1. Perform a self-join on the `Employee` table based on the `managerId` column.
2. Select the employees whose salary is greater than their manager's salary.
3. Return the result table with the names of employees who earn more than their managers.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Employee` table.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from the input and output tables.

:

```java
# Java
SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
```

```cpp
# C++
SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
```

```python
# Python
SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
```
