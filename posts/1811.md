## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We sort both the scores and the lower bounds arrays in ascending order. Then, we iterate through the scores and lower bounds arrays using two pointers to find the number of candidates that meet the score requirements.

1. Sort the `scores` and `lower_bounds` arrays in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of candidates that meet the score requirements.
3. Iterate through both arrays using two pointers:
   - If the current score is greater than or equal to the current lower bound, increment the count.
   - Move the pointers accordingly.
4. Return the count as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(nlogn) where n is the length of the input arrays due to sorting the arrays before processing.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findInterviewCandidates(int[] scores, int[] lower_bounds) {
        Arrays.sort(scores);
        Arrays.sort(lower_bounds);
        
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < scores.length && j < lower_bounds.length) {
            if (scores[i] >= lower_bounds[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findInterviewCandidates(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& lower_bounds) {
        sort(scores.begin(), scores.end());
        sort(lower_bounds.begin(), lower_bounds.end());
        
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < scores.size() && j < lower_bounds.size()) {
            if (scores[i] >= lower_bounds[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findInterviewCandidates(self, scores: List[int], lower_bounds: List[int]) -> int:
        scores.sort()
        lower_bounds.sort()
        
        count = 0
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        while i < len(scores) and j < len(lower_bounds):
            if scores[i] >= lower_bounds[j]:
                count += 1
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        return count
```
