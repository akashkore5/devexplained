### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can split the input sentence `s` into words using the space character as the delimiter. Then we can take the first `k` words and concatenate them back together with a space between each word to form the truncated sentence.

### Algorithm:
1. Split the input sentence `s` into individual words using the space character as the delimiter.
2. Take the first `k` words from the list of words.
3. Join these `k` words back together with a space between each word to form the truncated sentence.
4. Return the truncated sentence.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sentence `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input sentence `s`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder truncated = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            truncated.append(words[i]);
            if (i < k - 1) {
                truncated.append(" ");
            }
        }
        return truncated.toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string truncateSentence(string s, int k) {
        stringstream ss(s);
        string word, truncated;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            ss >> word;
            truncated += word;
            if (i < k - 1) {
                truncated += " ";
            }
        }
        return truncated;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def truncateSentence(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        words = s.split()
        truncated = ' '.join(words[:k])
        return truncated
```
