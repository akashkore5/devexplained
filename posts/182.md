## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in the `Person` table. We can group the records by the `email` field and then filter out the groups where the count of emails is greater than 1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of rows in the `Person` table. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result.
### SQL
```sql
SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1
```

```java
// This problem can be solved using SQL query directly in the database
// No Java code implementation is needed
```

### C++
```cpp
// This problem can be solved using SQL query directly in the database
// No C++ code implementation is needed
```

### Python
```python
# This problem can be solved using SQL query directly in the database
# No Python code implementation is needed
