### Explanation:
To solve this problem efficiently, we can simulate the game using a circular linked list approach. We can create a circular linked list of size n and then iterate through the list while removing elements until only one element (the winner) remains. We can achieve this without actually creating the linked list by using a formula that calculates the position of the winner directly.

The formula to find the winner is:
```plaintext
f(n, k) = (f(n-1, k) + k) % n
f(1, k) = 0
```
where f(n, k) denotes the position of the winner when there are n friends and k steps to skip.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int winner = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            winner = (winner + k) % i;
        }
        return winner + 1;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int winner = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            winner = (winner + k) % i;
        }
        return winner + 1;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheWinner(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        winner = 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            winner = (winner + k) % i
        return winner + 1
```
