### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each query and each point to check if the point lies inside the circle defined by the query. For each query, we calculate the distance between the center of the circle and each point. If this distance is less than or equal to the radius of the circle, we increment the count of points inside the circle.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each query, iterate through each point.
2. Calculate the distance between the center of the circle and the point using the distance formula.
3. If the distance is less than or equal to the radius of the circle, increment the count of points inside the circle.
4. Store the count for each query in the answer array.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * m) where n is the number of points and m is the number of queries.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) (excluding the space required for the output).

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countPoints(int[][] points, int[][] queries) {
        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < points.length; j++) {
                int distance = (int) (Math.pow((points[j][0] - queries[i][0]), 2) + Math.pow((points[j][1] - queries[i][1]), 2));
                if (distance <= Math.pow(queries[i][2], 2)) {
                    answer[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> answer(queries.size(), 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); j++) {
                int distance = pow((points[j][0] - queries[i][0]), 2) + pow((points[j][1] - queries[i][1]), 2);
                if (distance <= pow(queries[i][2], 2)) {
                    answer[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countPoints(self, points: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        answer = [0] * len(queries)
        
        for i in range(len(queries)):
            for j in range(len(points)):
                distance = (points[j][0] - queries[i][0])**2 + (points[j][1] - queries[i][1])**2
                if distance <= queries[i][2]**2:
                    answer[i] += 1
        
        return answer
```
