### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find customers who never placed an order. We can achieve this by using a LEFT JOIN operation between the Customers and Orders tables and then filtering out the customers who have NULL values in the Orders table.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Perform a LEFT JOIN operation between the Customers and Orders tables using the `customerId` column.
2. Filter out the customers who have NULL values in the `customerId` column from the Orders table.
3. Return the names of customers who never placed an order.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Customers table.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Customers table.
