## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can convert the given number `n` from base 10 to base `k`. Then, we sum the digits of the converted number to get the final result. We can achieve this by repeatedly dividing the number by `k` to get the remainder which will be the least significant digit in base `k`. We keep track of the sum of digits as we go along.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. While `n` is greater than 0:
   - Calculate the remainder by taking `n % k`.
   - Add the remainder to `sum`.
   - Update `n` by doing integer division `n / k`.
3. Return the `sum`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log<sub>k</sub>(n)) where n is the input number and k is the base.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % k;
            n /= k;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % k;
            n /= k;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def sumBase(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        sum = 0
        while n > 0:
            sum += n % k
            n //= k
        return sum
```
