### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will sort the input array `nums` and then maintain a window such that the sum of all elements within the window can be increased to meet the constraint of at most `k` operations. We will slide this window across the array while updating the sum and keeping track of the maximum frequency of an element within the window.

Here are the steps:
1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Initialize variables `left` and `sum` to track the left boundary of the window and the current sum within the window, respectively.
3. Iterate over the array using a right pointer:
   - Calculate the cost to make all elements within the window equal by multiplying the current number by its frequency and subtracting the sum of elements within the window.
   - While the cost exceeds `k`, increment the left pointer and update the sum accordingly.
   - Update the maximum frequency of an element found in the window.
4. Return the maximum frequency found.

Time complexity: O(nlogn) due to sorting the array where n is the length of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1) since we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while ((long)nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - sum > k) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxFreq;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while ((long)nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - sum > k) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxFreq;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        _sum = 0
        max_freq = 0
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            _sum += nums[right]
            while nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - _sum > k:
                _sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_freq
```
