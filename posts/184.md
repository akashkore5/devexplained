## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the employees who have the highest salary in each department. We can achieve this by using a subquery to find the maximum salary for each department and then join it with the Employee table to get the corresponding employees.

1. Write a subquery to get the maximum salary for each department.
2. Join the subquery result with the Employee table to get the employees with the highest salary in each department.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of rows in the Employee table.
Space complexity: O(n)
