### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a min heap to keep track of the available seats. When a seat is reserved, we pop the smallest seat number from the heap. When a seat is unreserved, we add the seat number back to the heap. 

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a min heap to store available seats.
2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the next available seat number.
3. In the constructor, populate the min heap with seat numbers from 1 to n.
4. In the reserve() method, pop the top of the min heap and return the seat number.
5. In the unreserve() method, add the seat number back to the min heap.

**Time Complexity:**
- Reserve operation: O(log n) where n is the number of seats.
- Unreserve operation: O(log n)
- Overall time complexity for n reserve and unreserve operations: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n) for storing the heap.

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class SeatManager {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> availableSeats;
    
    public SeatManager(int n) {
        availableSeats = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            availableSeats.add(i);
        }
    }
    
    public int reserve() {
        return availableSeats.poll();
    }
    
    public void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        availableSeats.add(seatNumber);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class SeatManager {
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> availableSeats;
public:
    SeatManager(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            availableSeats.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    int reserve() {
        int seat = availableSeats.top();
        availableSeats.pop();
        return seat;
    }
    
    void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        availableSeats.push(seatNumber);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
import heapq

class SeatManager:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.available_seats = list(range(1, n+1))
        heapq.heapify(self.available_seats)
    
    def reserve(self) -> int:
        return heapq.heappop(self.available_seats)
    
    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.available_seats, seatNumber)
```
