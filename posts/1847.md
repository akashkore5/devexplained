### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can sort the rooms by size in descending order. Then, for each query, we iterate through the sorted rooms and find the closest room that meets the size requirement. We can use a TreeSet in Java or a set in C++ and Python to efficiently find the closest room based on the preferred room number.

1. Sort the rooms by size in descending order.
2. For each query:
   - Iterate through the sorted rooms.
   - Use a TreeSet (Java) or a set (C++/Python) to efficiently find the closest room based on the preferred room number.
   - Check if the room meets the size requirement.
   - Update the answer accordingly.

**Time Complexity:** O((n + k) * log n) where n is the number of rooms and k is the number of queries. Sorting the rooms takes O(n * log n) time, and processing each query takes O(log n) time for finding the closest room.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the sorted rooms.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] closestRoom(int[][] rooms, int[][] queries) {
        Arrays.sort(rooms, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[1], a[1]));
        TreeSet<Integer> roomIds = new TreeSet<>();
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int preferred = queries[i][0];
            int minSize = queries[i][1];
            int closestRoomId = -1;
            int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

            for (int[] room : rooms) {
                if (room[1] < minSize) {
                    break;
                }
                if (roomIds.contains(room[0])) {
                    continue;
                }

                int diff = Math.abs(room[0] - preferred);
                if (diff < minDiff || (diff == minDiff && room[0] < closestRoomId)) {
