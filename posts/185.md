### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query to rank the employees within each department based on their salaries. Then, we can select the employees who have ranks less than or equal to 3 for each department.
#### SQL Query
```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary) 
    FROM Employee e2 
    WHERE e2.salary > e.salary AND e2.departmentId = e.departmentId
) < 3
ORDER BY d.name, e.salary DESC
