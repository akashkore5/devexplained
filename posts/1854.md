### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate over each year in the range of birth and death years provided in the logs. We maintain a count of the population for each year by incrementing for births and decrementing for deaths. Finally, we find the year with the maximum population.

- We create an array `population` to store the population count for each year.
- We iterate over each entry in the `logs` array, incrementing the population count for birth year and decrementing for the year before the death year.
- After processing all entries, we find the year with the maximum population count.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of entries in the logs array.
Space complexity: O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array to store population counts for each year.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {
        int[] population = new int[2051];
        for (int i = 0; i < logs.length; i++) {
            population[logs[i][0]]++;
            population[logs[i][1]]--;
        }
        
        int maxPopulation = 0;
        int maxYear = 0;
        int currentPopulation = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1950; i <= 2050; i++) {
            currentPopulation += population[i];
            if (currentPopulation > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = currentPopulation;
                maxYear = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxYear;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumPopulation(vector<vector<int>>& logs) {
        vector<int> population(2051, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < logs.size(); i++) {
            population[logs[i][0]]++;
            population[logs[i][1]]--;
        }
        
        int maxPopulation = 0;
        int maxYear = 0;
        int currentPopulation = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1950; i <= 2050; i++) {
            currentPopulation += population[i];
            if (currentPopulation > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = currentPopulation;
                maxYear = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxYear;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumPopulation(self, logs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        population = [0] * 2051
        for log in logs:
            population[log[0]] += 1
            population[log[1]] -= 1
        
        max_population = 0
        max_year = 0
        current_population = 0
        
        for i in range(1950, 2051):
            current_population += population[i]
            if current_population > max_population:
                max_population = current_population
                max_year = i
        
        return max_year
