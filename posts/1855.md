## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through both arrays simultaneously. We start with the first element of both arrays and try to find the maximum valid pair with the largest distance. Since the arrays are non-increasing, we can move to the next element in the array with the larger value to potentially increase the distance. We keep track of the maximum distance found so far and update it whenever we find a valid pair with a larger distance. 

The key idea is to use a two-pointer approach where we maintain two pointers, one for each array. We move the pointers based on the given conditions until we reach the end of either array. By doing this, we can find the maximum distance between a pair of values.

- Time complexity: O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of nums1 and nums2 respectively.
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, maxDistance = 0;
        
        while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
            if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
                maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, j - i);
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, maxDistance = 0;
        
        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
                maxDistance = max(maxDistance, j - i);
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        i, j, maxDistance = 0, 0, 0
        
        while i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
            if nums1[i] <= nums2[j]:
                maxDistance = max(maxDistance, j - i)
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        return maxDistance
```
