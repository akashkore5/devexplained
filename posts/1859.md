## Explanation
To reconstruct the original sentence from the shuffled sentence, we can follow these steps:
1. Split the shuffled sentence by space to get individual words with their indices.
2. Sort the words based on their indices.
3. Remove the indices from the sorted words and concatenate them to form the original sentence.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of words in the sentence.
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of words in the sentence.
```java
class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.charAt(a.length() - 1) - b.charAt(b.length() - 1));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String word : words) {
            sb.append(word, 0, word.length() - 1).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string sortSentence(string s) {
        vector<string> words;
        stringstream ss(s);
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
            return a.back() < b.back();
        });
        string result;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            result += word.substr(0, word.size() - 1) + " ";
        }
        return result.substr(0, result.size() - 1);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def sortSentence(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split()
        words.sort(key=lambda x: x[-1])
        result = ' '.join(word[:-1] for word in words)
        return result
```
