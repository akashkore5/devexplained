### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the allocation of memory bits in each second until the program crashes. We will keep track of the available memory in both sticks and allocate memory to the stick with more available memory at each second. The program crashes when neither stick has enough memory to allocate.

We can iterate over the seconds, incrementing the memory allocation each time and updating the available memory in both sticks. We keep track of the crash time and the available memory in both sticks when the program crashes.

- Time complexity: O(sqrt(max(memory1, memory2))) as the program crashes when the allocated memory exceeds the total memory available in both sticks.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int time = 1;
        while (memory1 >= time || memory2 >= time) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2) {
                memory1 -= time;
            } else {
                memory2 -= time;
            }
            time++;
        }
        return new int[]{time, memory1, memory2};
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int time = 1;
        while (memory1 >= time || memory2 >= time) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2) {
                memory1 -= time;
            } else {
                memory2 -= time;
            }
            time++;
        }
        return {time, memory1, memory2};
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def memLeak(self, memory1: int, memory2: int) -> List[int]:
        time = 1
        while memory1 >= time or memory2 >= time:
            if memory1 >= memory2:
                memory1 -= time
            else:
                memory2 -= time
            time += 1
        return [time, memory1, memory2]
```
