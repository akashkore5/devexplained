### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate over each column from right to left. For each column, we can simulate the falling of stones due to gravity. Starting from the bottom row, if we encounter a stone ('#'), we try to move it downwards until it lands on an obstacle ('*') or another stone.

We can achieve this by maintaining a pointer to track the current position of the stone. If the position below the current position is empty ('.'), we keep moving the stone downwards. If the position below is an obstacle or another stone, we stop moving the stone and update the grid accordingly.

After processing all columns, we will obtain the final state of the box after rotation.

- Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
- Space Complexity: O(1) as we are modifying the input grid in place.```java
class Solution {
    public char[][] rotateTheBox(char[][] boxGrid) {
        int m = boxGrid.length;
        int n = boxGrid[0].length;

        for (int col = n - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
            int currRow = m - 1;
            int stonePos = m - 1;

            while (currRow >= 0) {
                if (boxGrid[currRow][col] == '#') {
                    boxGrid[currRow][col] = '.';
                    boxGrid[stonePos][col] = '#';
                    stonePos--;
                } else if (boxGrid[currRow][col] == '*') {
                    stonePos = currRow - 1;
                }
                currRow--;
            }
        }

        return boxGrid;
    }
}
```

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<char>> rotateTheBox(vector<vector<char>>& boxGrid) {
        int m = boxGrid.size();
        int n = boxGrid[0].size();

        for (int col = n - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
            int currRow = m - 1;
            int stonePos = m - 1;

            while (currRow >= 0) {
                if (boxGrid[currRow][col] == '#') {
                    boxGrid[currRow][col] = '.';
                    boxGrid[stonePos][col] = '#';
                    stonePos--;
                } else if (boxGrid[currRow][col] == '*') {
                    stonePos = currRow - 1;
                }
                currRow--;
            }
        }

        return boxGrid;
    }
};
```

### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateTheBox(self, boxGrid: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        m = len(boxGrid)
        n = len(boxGrid[0])

        for col in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            currRow = m - 1
            stonePos = m - 1

            while currRow >= 0:
                if boxGrid[currRow][col] == '#':
                    boxGrid[currRow][col] = '.'
                    boxGrid[stonePos][col] = '#'
                    stonePos -= 1
                elif boxGrid[currRow][col] == '*':
                    stonePos = currRow - 1
                currRow -= 1

        return boxGrid
```
