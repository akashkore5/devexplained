## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the minimum positive integer speed required for all the trains to reach the office on time. We can perform a binary search on the possible speeds and check if it is possible to reach the office on time with that speed. If it is possible, we update our lower bound, else we update our upper bound.

We start with a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound of 10^7 (as given in the problem constraints). At each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the total time required to travel all distances at the current speed. If the total time is less than or equal to the given hour, we update our lower bound to the mid speed. Otherwise, we update our upper bound.

The binary search continues until the lower bound becomes greater than the upper bound, at which point we return the lower bound as the minimum speed required to arrive on time. If after the binary search the lower bound exceeds the upper bound, we return -1 as it is impossible to arrive on time.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * log(10^7)), where n is the number of trains, as we perform a binary search on the possible speeds.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSpeedOnTime(int[] dist, double hour) {
        int n = dist.length;
        int left = 1, right = (int)1e7, res = -1;
        
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            double totalHours = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                totalHours += Math.ceil((double)dist[i] / mid);
            }
            totalHours += (double)dist[n - 1] / mid;
            
            if(totalHours <= hour) {
                res = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        int n = dist.size();
        int left = 1, right = 1e7, res = -1;
        
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            double totalHours = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                totalHours += ceil((double)dist[i] / mid);
            }
            totalHours += (double)dist[n - 1] / mid;
            
            if(totalHours <= hour) {
                res = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minSpeedOnTime(self, dist: List[int], hour: float) -> int:
        n = len(dist)
        left, right, res = 1, int(1e7), -1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            total_hours = 0
            for i in range(n - 1):
                total_hours += math.ceil(dist[i] / mid)
            total_hours += dist[n - 1] / mid
            
            if total_hours <= hour:
                res = mid
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return res
