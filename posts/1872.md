### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate from the end of the array and keep track of the maximum score that can be achieved by Alice starting from that point. At each step, we calculate the maximum score that Alice can achieve by either taking the next stone or skipping it.

The core idea is to maintain a running sum of stones from right to left. At each point, we calculate the maximum score Alice can achieve and update it. Finally, we return the maximum score that Alice can achieve starting from the first stone.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int stoneGameVIII(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            stones[i] += stones[i - 1];
        }
        
        int dp = stones[n - 1];
        int maxScore = dp;
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i > 0; i--) {
            dp = Math.max(dp, stones[i] - dp);
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, dp);
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameVIII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int n = stones.size();
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            stones[i] += stones[i - 1];
        }
        
        int dp = stones[n - 1];
        int maxScore = dp;
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i > 0; i--) {
            dp = max(dp, stones[i] - dp);
            maxScore = max(maxScore, dp);
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGameVIII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(stones)
        for i in range(1, n):
            stones[i] += stones[i - 1]
        
        dp = stones[n - 1]
        max_score = dp
        
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            dp = max(dp, stones[i] - dp)
            max_score = max(max_score, dp)
        
        return max_score
```
