### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to filter the employees based on the given conditions and calculate their bonus accordingly. We will iterate through each row of the Employees table, check if the employee's ID is odd and the name does not start with 'M', and then calculate the bonus. Finally, we will return the result table ordered by employee_id.

- Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of rows in the Employees table.
- Space complexity: O(N) for the result table.
```java
# Java solution
SELECT employee_id, 
       CASE 
           WHEN employee_id % 2 != 0 AND LEFT(name, 1) != 'M' THEN salary
           ELSE 0
       END AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

```cpp
// C++ solution
SELECT employee_id, 
       CASE 
           WHEN employee_id % 2 != 0 AND LEFT(name, 1) != 'M' THEN salary
           ELSE 0
       END AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

```python
# Python solution
SELECT employee_id, 
       CASE 
           WHEN employee_id % 2 != 0 AND LEFT(name, 1) != 'M' THEN salary
           ELSE 0
       END AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;
```
