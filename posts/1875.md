## Explanation:

To group employees of the same salary, we can use a hashmap to store the employees with the same salary together. We iterate through the list of employees and store each employee in the corresponding group based on their salary. Finally, we return a list of lists where each inner list contains employees with the same salary.

Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap to store employees with the same salary.
2. Iterate through the list of employees.
3. For each employee, check if their salary group exists in the hashmap.
4. If the group does not exist, create a new list for that salary group and add the employee to the list.
5. If the group already exists, append the employee to the existing list.
6. Finally, return a list containing all the salary groups.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of employees
Space Complexity: O(n), to store the hashmap

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupEmployees(List<String> employees) {
        Map<Integer, List<String>> salaryGroups = new HashMap<>();
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (String employee : employees) {
            String[] empDetails = employee.split(",");
            String name = empDetails[0];
            int salary = Integer.parseInt(empDetails[1]);

            if (!salaryGroups.containsKey(salary)) {
                salaryGroups.put(salary, new ArrayList<>());
            }
            salaryGroups.get(salary).add(name);
        }

        for (List<String> group : salaryGroups.values()) {
            result.add(group);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupEmployees(vector<string>& employees) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<string>> salaryGroups;
        vector<vector<string>> result;

        for (string employee : employees) {
            size_t pos = employee.find(",");
            string name = employee.substr(0, pos);
            int salary = stoi(employee.substr(pos + 1));

            salaryGroups[salary].push_back(name);
        }

        for (auto& group : salaryGroups) {
            result.push_back(group.second);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def groupEmployees(self, employees: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        salaryGroups = {}
        result = []

        for employee in employees:
            name, salary = employee.split(",")
            salary = int(salary)

            if salary not in salaryGroups:
                salaryGroups[salary] = []
            salaryGroups[salary].append(name)

        for group in salaryGroups.values():
            result.append(group)

        return result
```
