### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the input array in non-increasing order.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and calculate the number of operations required based on the frequency of each element.
3. Keep track of the total number of operations performed.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of elements in the array due to sorting.
Space Complexity: O(n) to store the frequency of each element.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int reductionOperations(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int operations = 0;
        int totalOps = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                operations++;
            }
            totalOps += operations;
        }
        
        return totalOps;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reductionOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
        int n = nums.size();
        int operations = 0;
        int totalOps = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                operations++;
            }
            totalOps += operations;
        }
        
        return totalOps;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reductionOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        n = len(nums)
        operations = 0
        totalOps = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
                operations += 1
            totalOps += operations
        
        return totalOps
```
