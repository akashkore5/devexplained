### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to filter the logins for the year 2020 and then find the latest login for each user who logged in during that year. We can achieve this by using a SQL query that groups the logins by user_id and selects the maximum time_stamp for each user who logged in during the year 2020. 

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT user_id, MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM Logins
WHERE YEAR(time_stamp) = 2020
GROUP BY user_id;
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT user_id, MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM Logins
WHERE YEAR(time_stamp) = 2020
GROUP BY user_id;
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT user_id, MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM Logins
WHERE YEAR(time_stamp) = 2020
GROUP BY user_id;
```
