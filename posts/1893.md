### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each integer in the range `[left, right]` and check if it is covered by at least one interval in the `ranges` array. We can do this by creating a boolean array of size 51 (to represent integers from 0 to 50) and marking each integer that is covered by an interval. Finally, we check if all integers in the range `[left, right]` are marked as covered.

- Initialize a boolean array `covered` of size 51, all initialized to false.
- Iterate over each interval in the `ranges` array and mark the integers in the range as covered.
- Iterate over the range `[left, right]` and check if all integers are covered.
- Return true if all integers are covered, false otherwise.

Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of intervals in `ranges` and m is the size of the range `[left, right]`.
Space Complexity: O(1) since the boolean array `covered` is of constant size.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isCovered(int[][] ranges, int left, int right) {
        boolean[] covered = new boolean[51]; // Represents integers from 0 to 50
        for (int[] range : ranges) {
            for (int i = range[0]; i <= range[1]; i++) {
                covered[i] = true;
            }
        }
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (!covered[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCovered(vector<vector<int>>& ranges, int left, int right) {
        vector<bool> covered(51, false); // Represents integers from 0 to 50
        for (auto& range : ranges) {
            for (int i = range[0]; i <= range[1]; i++) {
                covered[i] = true;
            }
        }
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (!covered[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isCovered(self, ranges: List[List[int]], left: int, right: int) -> bool:
        covered = [False] * 51 # Represents integers from 0 to 50
        for start, end in ranges:
            for i in range(start, end+1):
                covered[i] = True
        for i in range(left, right+1):
            if not covered[i]:
                return False
        return True
```
