### Explanation:
- We need to simulate the process of distributing chalk to students until the chalk runs out.
- We iterate through the students in a cyclic manner, deducting the chalk used by each student.
- If at any point the remaining chalk is less than the chalk required by the current student, we return the index of that student.

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            sum += c;
        }
        long remainder = k % sum;
        
        int student = 0;
        while (remainder >= chalk[student]) {
            remainder -= chalk[student];
            student++;
        }
        return student;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int chalkReplacer(vector<int>& chalk, int k) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            sum += c;
        }
        long long remainder = k % sum;
        
        int student = 0;
        while (remainder >= chalk[student]) {
            remainder -= chalk[student];
            student++;
        }
        return student;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def chalkReplacer(self, chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        total_chalk = sum(chalk)
        remainder = k % total_chalk
        
        student = 0
        while remainder >= chalk[student]:
            remainder -= chalk[student]
            student += 1
        return student
```
