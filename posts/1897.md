### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to redistribute characters in the given strings such that all strings become equal. We can achieve this by counting the frequency of each character in all the strings and checking if the count of each character is divisible by the total number of strings. If this condition is met for all characters, we can redistribute the characters to make all strings equal.

1. Iterate through all the strings and count the frequency of each character.
2. Check if the count of each character is divisible by the total number of strings.
3. If the above condition is true for all characters, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Time complexity: O(n * m) where n is the number of strings and m is the average length of each string.
Space complexity: O(26) = O(1) since there are only 26 lowercase English letters.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean makeEqual(String[] words) {
        int[] charCount = new int[26];
        int totalStrings = words.length;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                charCount[c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        for (int count : charCount) {
            if (count % totalStrings != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool makeEqual(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> charCount(26, 0);
        int totalStrings = words.size();
        
        for (const string& word : words) {
            for (char c : word) {
                charCount[c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        for (int count : charCount) {
            if (count % totalStrings != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def makeEqual(self, words: List[str]) -> bool:
        char_count = [0] * 26
        total_strings = len(words)
        
        for word in words:
            for c in word:
                char_count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        for count in char_count:
            if count % total_strings != 0:
                return False
        
        return True
