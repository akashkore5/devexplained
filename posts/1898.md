### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to find the maximum k such that p is still a subsequence of s after removing k characters. We can create a helper function that checks if p is a subsequence of s after removing k characters at the given indices. Then, we perform binary search on the range [0, removable.length] to find the maximum valid k.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Define a helper function `isSubsequence` that checks if p is a subsequence of s after removing k characters at given indices.
2. Perform binary search on the range [0, removable.length] to find the maximum valid k.
3. In each iteration of binary search, check if p is still a subsequence after removing mid characters at given indices.
4. Update the search range based on the result of the helper function.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * log(n)), where n is the length of removable.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) for storing the indices of removable.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumRemovals(String s, String p, int[] removable) {
        int low = 0, high = removable.length;
        
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if(isSubsequence(s, p, removable, mid)) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return high;
    }
    
    private boolean isSubsequence(String s, String p, int[] removable, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sb.setCharAt(removable[i], '*');
        }
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sb.length() && j < p.length(); i++) {
            if (sb.charAt(i) == p.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j == p.length();
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string p, vector<int>& removable, int k) {
        string temp = s;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            temp[removable[i]] = '*';
        }
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < temp.size() && j < p.size(); i++) {
            if (temp[i] == p[j]) {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j == p.size();
    }
    
    int maximumRemovals(string s, string p, vector<int>& removable) {
        int low = 0, high = removable.size();
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isSubsequence(s, p, removable, mid)) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return high;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, p: str, removable: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        temp = list(s)
        for i in range(k):
            temp[removable[i]] = '*'
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            if j < len(p) and temp[i] == p[j]:
                j += 1
        return j == len(p)
    
    def maximumRemovals(self, s: str, p: str, removable: List[int]) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(removable)
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            if self.isSubsequence(s, p, removable, mid):
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        return high
