### Explanation

To remove the nth node from the end of a linked list, we can use a two-pointer approach. We initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both pointing to the head of the linked list. We move the `fast` pointer to the nth node from the beginning. Then, we move both pointers simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the `slow` pointer will be pointing to the node just before the node to be removed. We update the `slow` pointer to skip the nth node from the end, effectively removing it from the list.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy;
        ListNode slow = dummy;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        while (fast != null) {
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        slow.next = slow.next.next;

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* fast = dummy;
        ListNode* slow = dummy;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        while (fast != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        
        slow->next = slow->next->next;
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        fast = dummy
        slow = dummy
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next
        
        while fast is not None:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        
        return dummy.next
```
