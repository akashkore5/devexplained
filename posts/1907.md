## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a simple SQL query to categorize the incomes into three categories: "Low Salary", "Average Salary", and "High Salary". We can then count the number of accounts in each category using a CASE statement in SQL.

:

### SQL
```sql
SELECT 
    'Low Salary' AS category, 
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts 
WHERE 
    income < 20000
UNION 
SELECT 
    'Average Salary' AS category, 
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts 
WHERE 
    income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
UNION 
SELECT 
    'High Salary' AS category, 
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM 
    Accounts 
WHERE 
    income > 50000;
```
