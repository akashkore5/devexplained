## Explanation
The Game of Nim is a two-player game where players take turns removing stones from distinct piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one stone, and they can remove any number of stones from a single pile. The player who removes the last stone wins the game.

To determine the winning strategy for the Nim game, we need to understand the concept of Nim sum. The Nim sum of a set of piles is calculated by XOR-ing the number of stones in each pile. If the Nim sum is 0, then the current player will lose the game, otherwise, they can win by making a move that leads to a Nim sum of 0.

For the Game of Nim with n piles, the winning strategy is to make the Nim sum of the initial state non-zero. This strategy guarantees that the player who starts the game can always win by making the correct moves.
```java
public boolean nimGame(int[] piles) {
    int nimSum = 0;
    for (int stones : piles) {
        nimSum ^= stones;
    }
    return nimSum != 0;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool nimGame(vector<int>& piles) {
        int nimSum = 0;
        for (int stones : piles) {
            nimSum ^= stones;
        }
        return nimSum != 0;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def nimGame(self, piles: List[int]) -> bool:
        nimSum = 0
        for stones in piles:
            nimSum ^= stones
        return nimSum != 0
```
