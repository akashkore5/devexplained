## Explanation:
To find the number of set bits in the binary representation of a positive integer `n`, we can use the bitwise AND operation with `1` to check the least significant bit. If the result is `1`, we increment a counter. We then right shift the number by 1 bit to move to the next bit. We repeat this process until the number becomes `0`.

Time complexity: O(log n) - where n is the input number  
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += n & 1
            n >>= 1
        return count
```
