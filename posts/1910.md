### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string `s` and keep removing occurrences of the substring `part` until there are no more occurrences left. We can achieve this by using the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of `part`. If the index is found, we remove the substring at that index. We repeat this process until no more occurrences of `part` are present in `s`.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `index` to store the index of the first occurrence of `part` in `s`.
2. While `index` is not equal to -1, remove the substring `part` at the index `index` in `s`.
3. Update the value of `index` to the index of the next occurrence of `part`.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more occurrences of `part` are found in `s`.
5. Return the modified string `s`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n*m), where n is the length of the string `s` and m is the length of the substring `part`. In the worst case, we may have to iterate through the entire string `s` multiple times to remove all occurrences of `part`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are modifying the string `s` in-place without using any additional data structures.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        int index = s.indexOf(part);
        while (index != -1) {
            s = s.substring(0, index) + s.substring(index + part.length());
            index = s.indexOf(part);
        }
        return s;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeOccurrences(string s, string part) {
        size_t index = s.find(part);
        while (index != string::npos) {
            s.erase(index, part.length());
            index = s.find(part);
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        index = s.find(part)
        while index != -1:
            s = s[:index] + s[index + len(part):]
            index = s.find(part)
        return s
```
