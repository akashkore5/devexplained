### Explanation

To maximize the product difference between two pairs, we need to select two pairs of numbers that have the largest difference in their products. We can achieve this by sorting the input array. By sorting the array in ascending order, we ensure that the largest numbers are at the end and the smallest numbers are at the beginning. Then, we can calculate the product difference by taking the product of the last two numbers and the product of the first two numbers.

### Algorithm
1. Sort the input array `nums` in ascending order.
2. Calculate the product difference by taking the product of the last two numbers and the product of the first two numbers.
3. Return the maximum product difference calculated.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxProductDifference(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        return (nums[n - 1] * nums[n - 2]) - (nums[0] * nums[1]);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProductDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        return (nums[n - 1] * nums[n - 2]) - (nums[0] * nums[1]);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProductDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return (nums[-1] * nums[-2]) - (nums[0] * nums[1])
```
