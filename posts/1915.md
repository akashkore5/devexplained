## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a bitmask to represent the parity of each character in the given string. We will iterate through the string and keep track of the prefix XOR value for each character. If a substring has at most one character appearing an odd number of times, then the XOR value of the characters in that substring will have at most one bit set to 1.

For each character in the string, we can toggle the bit representing the parity of that character in the prefix XOR value. We can then count the number of substrings where the XOR value has at most one bit set to 1. To do this, we can use a hashmap to store the count of each prefix XOR value seen so far. 

As we iterate through the string, we update the count of substrings based on the previously seen prefix XOR values. Finally, we return the total count of wonderful substrings.

Time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: O(1) since the size of the hashmap is fixed at 1024 (representing all possible bitmasks for the characters 'a' to 'j').
```java
class Solution {
    public long wonderfulSubstrings(String word) {
        long res = 0;
        int mask = 0;
        long[] count = new long[1024];
        count[0] = 1;
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            mask ^= 1 << (c - 'a');
            res += count[mask];
            
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                res += count[mask ^ (1 << i)];
            }
            
            count[mask]++;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long wonderfulSubstrings(string word) {
        long long res = 0;
        int mask = 0;
        vector<long long> count(1024, 0);
        count[0] = 1;
        
        for (char c : word) {
            mask ^= 1 << (c - 'a');
            res += count[mask];
            
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                res += count[mask ^ (1 << i)];
            }
            
            count[mask]++;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def wonderfulSubstrings(self, word: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        mask = 0
        count = [0] * 1024
        count[0] = 1
        
        for c in word:
            mask ^= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))
            res += count[mask]
            
            for i in range(10):
                res += count[mask ^ (1 << i)]
            
            count[mask] += 1
        
        return res
```
