### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a topological ordering approach. We can first construct a directed graph where each node represents a room, and the edges represent the dependency relationship between rooms. Then, we can perform a topological sort to determine the order in which rooms should be built. After that, we can iterate over the sorted order and calculate the number of ways to build the rooms based on the dependencies.

- **Algorithm:**
  1. Construct a directed graph based on the dependencies provided in `prevRoom`.
  2. Perform a topological sort to determine the order in which rooms should be built.
  3. Initialize a `dp` array to track the number of ways to build each room based on the dependencies.
  4. Iterate over the sorted order and update the `dp` array accordingly.
  5. Return the total number of ways to build all rooms modulo 10^9 + 7.

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of rooms.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for storing the graph and dp array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int waysToBuildRooms(int[] prevRoom) {
        int n = prevRoom.length;
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            graph[prevRoom[i]].add(i);
        }

        int[] factorial = new int[n + 1];
        factorial[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial[i] = (int)((long)factorial[i - 1] * i % 1000000007);
        }

        int[] size = new int[n];
        int[] ways = new int[n];
        dfs(graph, 0, size, ways, factorial);

        return ways[0];
    }
