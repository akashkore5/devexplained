### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use Unix commands like `cat`, `tr`, `sed`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `awk` in a pipeline to count the frequency of each word in the text file. Here's a step-by-step approach:
1. `cat words.txt`: Display the contents of the text file.
2. `tr ' ' '\n'`: Replace spaces with newlines to split the words.
3. `sed '/^$/d'`: Remove empty lines.
4. `sort`: Sort the words.
5. `uniq -c`: Count the frequency of each unique word.
6. `sort -nr`: Sort based on frequency in descending order.
7. `awk '{print $2, $1}'`: Print the word and its frequency.

One-liner using Unix pipes:

```bash
cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sed '/^$/d' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'
