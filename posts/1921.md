### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the game by keeping track of the time it takes for each monster to reach the city. We can then sort these times and eliminate monsters one by one until we either eliminate all monsters or a monster reaches the city.

1. Calculate the time each monster takes to reach the city using the formula: time = (dist[i] - 1) / speed[i].
2. Sort the times in ascending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted times and eliminate monsters until a monster reaches the city or all monsters are eliminated.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int eliminateMaximum(int[] dist, int[] speed) {
        int n = dist.length;
        int[] times = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            times[i] = (dist[i] - 1) / speed[i];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(times);
        
        int eliminated = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (times[i] < i) {
                break;
            }
            eliminated++;
        }
        
        return eliminated;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eliminateMaximum(vector<int>& dist, vector<int>& speed) {
        int n = dist.size();
        vector<int> times(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            times[i] = (dist[i] - 1) / speed[i];
        }
        
        sort(times.begin(), times.end());
        
        int eliminated = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (times[i] < i) {
                break;
            }
            eliminated++;
        }
        
        return eliminated;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def eliminateMaximum(self, dist: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(dist)
        times = [(dist[i] - 1) // speed[i] for i in range(n)]
        times.sort()
        
        eliminated = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if times[i] < i:
                break
            eliminated += 1
        
        return eliminated
```
