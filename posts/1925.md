### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible combinations of (a, b, c) such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n, and check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2. We can use three nested loops to iterate through all possible values of a, b, and c. For each combination, we check if the condition a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is satisfied, and if so, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of square triples.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3) as we are iterating through all possible combinations of a, b, and c.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriples(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    if (a * a + b * b == c * c) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTriples(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
                for (int c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    if (a * a + b * b == c * c) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countTriples(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n+1):
            for b in range(1, n+1):
                for c in range(1, n+1):
                    if a**2 + b**2 == c**2:
                        count += 1
        return count
```
