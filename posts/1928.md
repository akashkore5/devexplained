## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm with a slight modification to keep track of the total time taken as well as the total cost incurred at each city. We will initialize our priority queue with the starting city (city 0) and maintain a visited set to avoid revisiting cities unnecessarily.

1. Start by creating a priority queue to store the current city, total time taken, and total cost incurred at that city.
2. Initialize the priority queue with (city 0, time 0, cost 0) and add it to the visited set.
3. While the priority queue is not empty:
    - Pop the top element from the priority queue.
    - If the current city is the destination city (city n-1) and the total time taken is less than or equal to maxTime, return the total cost incurred.
    - Iterate through all the neighboring cities of the current city:
        - Calculate the new time taken and cost incurred if we choose to travel to the neighboring city.
        - If the neighboring city has not been visited or the new time taken is less than the previously recorded time taken at that city, update the information and add it to the priority queue.
4. If we reach this point, it means we cannot reach the destination city within the given maxTime, so return -1.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(E * log(V)), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(V) for the priority queue and visited set.
