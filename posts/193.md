### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a one-liner bash script that utilizes regular expressions to match the valid phone number formats. We can use the `grep` command with the `-P` option to specify a Perl-compatible regular expression pattern. The regular expression pattern can be constructed to match either of the two valid phone number formats: `(xxx) xxx-xxxx` or `xxx-xxx-xxxx`.
