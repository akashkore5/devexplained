## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string `s` and check if there exists a valid palindromic subsequence of length 3 centered around the current character. We can do this by checking for characters that are the same as the current character but different from the previous and next characters. If such characters exist, we increment the count of valid palindromic subsequences.

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the count of valid palindromic subsequences.
2. Iterate through each character `c` in the string `s`.
3. For each character `c`, check if there exists two other characters `a` and `b` such that `a = b = c` and `a` is not equal to the previous character and `b` is not equal to the next character.
4. If the above condition is met, increment the `count`.
5. Finally, return the `count`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countPalindromicSubsequences(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (s.charAt(i - 1) == c) {
                for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                    if (ch != c && s.indexOf(ch, i + 1) != -1) {
                        count++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequences(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            char c = s[i];
            if (s[i - 1] == c) {
                for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                    if (ch != c && s.find(ch, i + 1) != string::npos) {
                        count++;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countPalindromicSubsequences(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):
            if s[i - 1] == s[i]:
                for ch in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    if ch != s[i] and ch in s[i + 1:]:
                        count += 1
                        break
        return count
```
