### Explanation:
To calculate the confirmation rate for each user, we need to count the number of confirmed messages for each user and divide it by the total number of requested confirmation messages. We can use SQL to join the Signups and Confirmations tables, count the number of confirmed messages for each user, and calculate the confirmation rate accordingly.

:

#### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT s.user_id, 
    IFNULL(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(c.user_id) AS DECIMAL(5,2)), 0.00) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
```
