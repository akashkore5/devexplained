## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of words in the given text that can be fully typed using the functioning keys on the keyboard. We can iterate through each word in the text and check if all the letters in that word are present in the set of functioning keys. If any letter in the word is part of the broken letters set, we skip that word.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a set to store the broken letters.
2. Split the text into words using space as a delimiter.
3. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
4. Iterate through each word in the text.
   - For each word, iterate through its characters.
   - If any character is present in the set of broken letters, break and move to the next word.
   - If all characters are valid, increment the `count`.
5. Return the `count`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*m), where n is the number of words in the text and m is the average length of a word.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of distinct broken letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int canBeTypedWords(String text, String brokenLetters) {
        Set<Character> brokenSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (char c : brokenLetters.toCharArray()) {
            brokenSet.add(c);
        }
        
        String[] words = text.split(" ");
        int count = 0;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean canType = true;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                if (brokenSet.contains(c)) {
                    canType = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (canType) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canBeTypedWords(string text, string brokenLetters) {
        unordered_set<char> brokenSet;
        for (char c : brokenLetters) {
            brokenSet.insert(c);
        }
        
        stringstream ss(text);
        string word;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (ss >> word) {
            bool canType = true;
            for (char c : word) {
                if (brokenSet.find(c) != brokenSet.end()) {
                    canType = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (canType) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeTypedWords(self, text: str, brokenLetters: str) -> int:
        brokenSet = set(brokenLetters)
        words = text.split()
        count = 0
        
        for word in words:
            canType = True
            for c in word:
                if c in brokenSet:
                    canType = False
                    break
            if canType:
                count += 1
        
        return count
