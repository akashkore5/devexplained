### Explanation
We can solve this problem by iterating over the rungs and calculating the difference between the current rung and the next rung. If this difference is greater than the allowed distance `dist`, we need to add additional rungs to bridge the gap. The number of additional rungs needed can be calculated by dividing the difference by `dist` and taking the ceiling of the result.

```java
class Solution {
    public int addRungs(int[] rungs, int dist) {
        int additionalRungs = 0;
        int currentHeight = 0;
        
        for (int rung : rungs) {
            additionalRungs += (rung - currentHeight - 1) / dist;
            currentHeight = rung;
        }
        
        return additionalRungs;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int addRungs(vector<int>& rungs, int dist) {
        int additionalRungs = 0;
        int currentHeight = 0;
        
        for (int rung : rungs) {
            additionalRungs += (rung - currentHeight - 1) / dist;
            currentHeight = rung;
        }
        
        return additionalRungs;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def addRungs(self, rungs: List[int], dist: int) -> int:
        additional_rungs = 0
        current_height = 0
        
        for rung in rungs:
            additional_rungs += (rung - current_height - 1) // dist
            current_height = rung
        
        return additional_rungs
```
