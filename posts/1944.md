### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a monotonic decreasing stack to keep track of the visible people in the queue. We iterate through the queue from right to left and maintain a stack of indices. For each person, we pop elements from the stack until we find a person taller than the current person or the stack becomes empty. The number of visible people for the current person is the difference between the current index and the top of the stack. Finally, we push the current index onto the stack.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of people in the queue.
Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of people in the queue.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] canSeePersonsCount(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && heights[i] > heights[stack.peek()]) {
                result[i] += 1 + result[stack.pop()];
            }
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                result[i]++;
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> canSeePersonsCount(vector<int>& heights) {
        int n = heights.size();
        vector<int> result(n);
        stack<int> st;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!st.empty() && heights[i] > heights[st.top()]) {
                result[i] += 1 + result[st.top()];
                st.pop();
            }
            if (!st.empty()) {
                result[i]++;
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def canSeePersonsCount(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(heights)
        result = [0] * n
        stack = []
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and heights[i] > heights[stack[-1]]:
                result[i] += 1 + result[stack.pop()]
            if stack:
                result[i] += 1
            stack.append(i)
        
        return result
```
