### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a Trie data structure to represent the folder structure. We will build the trie based on the input paths, and each node in the trie will represent a folder. Then, we can traverse the trie to identify and mark the duplicate folders and their subfolders. Finally, we can delete the marked folders and return the remaining paths.

#### Algorithm:
1. Build a Trie using the input paths.
2. Traverse the Trie to identify duplicate folders by comparing the children of each node.
3. Mark the duplicate folders and their subfolders for deletion.
4. Delete the marked folders.
5. Return the remaining paths.

#### Time Complexity:
- Building the Trie: O(n * m), where n is the number of paths and m is the average length of a path.
- Traversing and marking the duplicate folders: O(n * m).
- Deleting the marked folders: O(n * m).
Overall time complexity: O(n * m).

#### Space Complexity:
- Trie data structure: O(n * m).
- Recursive stack space during traversal: O(m).
Overall space complexity: O(n * m).

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> deleteDuplicateFolder(List<List<String>> paths) {
        // Java solution
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> deleteDuplicateFolder(vector<vector<string>>& paths) {
        // C++ solution
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicateFolder(self, paths: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # Python solution
```
