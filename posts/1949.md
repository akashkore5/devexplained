### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of graph traversal. We will represent the friendships as an undirected graph where each friend is a node and each friendship is an edge connecting two nodes. Then, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each friend and counting the number of friends reachable within a distance of 2 (including the starting friend).

Algorithmic Steps:
1. Construct a graph where each node represents a friend and each edge represents a friendship.
2. Initialize a variable `strongFriendships` to count the number of strong friendships.
3. For each friend in the graph, perform a BFS or DFS to traverse the graph up to a distance of 2.
4. During the traversal, count the number of friends reached within a distance of 2 (including the starting friend).
5. Update `strongFriendships` with the count of friends reached within a distance of 2.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all friends in the graph.
7. Finally, return the total count of strong friendships.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (friends) and E is the number of edges (friendships) in the graph.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(V + E) to store the graph and perform the traversal.

```java
class Solution {
    public int strongFriendships(int n, int[][] friendships) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] friendship : friendships) {
            graph.get(friendship[0]).add(friendship[1]);
            graph.get(friendship[1]).add(friendship[0]);
        }
        
        int strongFriendships = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
            Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            queue.offer(i);
            visited[i] = true;
            int distance = 0;
            while (!queue.isEmpty() && distance <= 2) {
                int size = queue.size();
