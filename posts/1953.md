## Explanation
To maximize the number of weeks you can work on the projects, we need to consider the project with the most milestones and ensure we alternate between working on that project and another project to avoid violating the rules. We can calculate the maximum number of weeks by summing all milestones and subtracting the maximum milestone value. If the maximum milestone value is greater than or equal to the sum of all other milestones, we can work on all projects except the one with the maximum milestone value for one extra week.
```java
class Solution {
    public long numberOfWeeks(int[] milestones) {
        long sum = 0, maxMilestone = 0;
        for (int milestone : milestones) {
            sum += milestone;
            maxMilestone = Math.max(maxMilestone, milestone);
        }
        
        return Math.min((sum - maxMilestone) * 2 + 1, sum);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfWeeks(vector<int>& milestones) {
        long long sum = 0, maxMilestone = 0;
        for (int milestone : milestones) {
            sum += milestone;
            maxMilestone = max(maxMilestone, (long long)milestone);
        }
        
        return min((sum - maxMilestone) * 2 + 1, sum);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeeks(self, milestones: List[int]) -> int:
        total_sum = 0
        max_milestone = 0
        for milestone in milestones:
            total_sum += milestone
            max_milestone = max(max_milestone, milestone)
        
        return min((total_sum - max_milestone) * 2 + 1, total_sum)
```
