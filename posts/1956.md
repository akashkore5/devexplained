## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum time required for K virus variants to spread through the network. We can start with a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound of the maximum possible time. Then, we iteratively perform binary search to narrow down the search space until we find the minimum time where K virus variants can spread.

1. Define a function `canSpread` that takes the time as input and returns true if K virus variants can spread within that time.
2. Use binary search to find the minimum time required for K virus variants to spread.
3. Update the lower and upper bounds based on whether the virus variants can spread within the given time.
4. Finally, return the minimum time required.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N log M), where N is the number of nodes in the network and M is the maximum possible time.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTime(int[][] graph, int K) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int left = 1, right = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canSpread(graph, K, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private boolean canSpread(int[][] graph, int K, int time) {
        // Implementation of spreading logic
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTime(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int K) {
        int n = graph.size();
        int left = 1, right = INT_MAX;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canSpread(graph, K, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    bool canSpread(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int K, int time) {
        // Implementation of spreading logic
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minTime(self, graph: List[List[int]], K: int) -> int:
        n = len(graph)
        left, right = 1, float('inf')
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if self.canSpread(graph, K, mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
                
        return left
    
    def canSpread(self, graph: List[List[int]], K: int, time: int) -> bool:
        # Implementation of spreading logic
