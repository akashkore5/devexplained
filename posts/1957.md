### Explanation:
To make a fancy string, we need to remove characters such that no three consecutive characters are equal. We can achieve this by iterating through the string and removing characters when we encounter three consecutive equal characters. We can do this by keeping track of the current character and the count of consecutive characters seen so far.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public String makeFancyString(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 1;
        char prev = s.charAt(0);
        sb.append(prev);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char curr = s.charAt(i);
            if (curr == prev) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 1;
                prev = curr;
            }
            
            if (count < 3) {
                sb.append(curr);
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string makeFancyString(string s) {
        string result = "";
        int count = 1;
        char prev = s[0];
        result += prev;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char curr = s[i];
            if (curr == prev) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 1;
                prev = curr;
            }
            
            if (count < 3) {
                result += curr;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = ""
        count = 1
        prev = s[0]
        result += prev
        
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            curr = s[i]
            if curr == prev:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 1
                prev = curr
                
            if count < 3:
                result += curr
                
        return result
```
