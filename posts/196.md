### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to delete all duplicate emails in the `Person` table, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. We can achieve this by using a DELETE statement in SQL.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. We can use a DELETE statement with a common table expression (CTE) to delete duplicate emails based on the condition of having a smaller id.
2. The CTE can select the rows to delete by identifying duplicate emails with larger id values.
3. We then delete the rows from the original `Person` table based on the CTE results.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Person` table.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from the input `Person` table itself.

:

```java
// Java Solution
DELETE p
FROM Person p
JOIN (
    SELECT id, email
    FROM (
        SELECT id, email, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS rnum
        FROM Person
    ) tmp
    WHERE rnum > 1
) dup ON p.id = dup.id;
```

```cpp
// C++ Solution
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM (
        SELECT id, email, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS rnum
        FROM Person
    ) tmp
    WHERE rnum = 1
);
```

```python
# Python Solution
sql = '''
DELETE p
FROM Person p
JOIN (
    SELECT id, email
    FROM (
        SELECT id, email, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS rnum
        FROM Person
    ) tmp
    WHERE rnum > 1
) dup ON p.id = dup.id;
'''
