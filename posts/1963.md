## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate through the string and maintain the balance of opening and closing brackets. We keep track of the number of extra closing brackets encountered so far. If we encounter an opening bracket, we increment our balance. If we encounter a closing bracket and our balance is already positive (meaning we have extra closing brackets), we increment our swap count and decrement the balance.

The intuition behind this approach is that for a string to be balanced, each closing bracket should match with an opening bracket. By swapping, we can bring unmatched closing brackets closer to the opening brackets.

After iterating through the string, the number of swaps we made is the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int swaps = 0;
        int balance = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                balance++;
            } else {
                if (balance > 0) {
                    balance--;
                } else {
                    swaps++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int swaps = 0;
        int balance = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '[') {
                balance++;
            } else {
                if (balance > 0) {
                    balance--;
                } else {
                    swaps++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, s: str) -> int:
        swaps = 0
        balance = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if c == '[':
                balance += 1
            else:
                if balance > 0:
                    balance -= 1
                else:
                    swaps += 1
        
        return swaps
```
