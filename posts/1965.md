## Explanation
We can solve this problem by using a `LEFT JOIN` operation between the Employees and Salaries tables. This will allow us to identify the employees with missing information (i.e., employees who do not have corresponding entries in the Salaries table or in the Employees table). We can then filter out the employees with missing information to obtain the final result ordered by employee_id.

- Perform a `LEFT JOIN` operation between the Employees and Salaries tables on the employee_id column.
- Filter out the rows where either the name or salary is missing.
- Return the employee_id of the filtered rows in ascending order.

LEFT JOIN Salaries s
ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE e.name IS NULL OR s.salary IS NULL
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```
