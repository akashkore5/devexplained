## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate over each pattern and check if it is a substring of the given word. We can use the `contains()` method of the `String` class in Java and Python to check for substrings. For C++, we can use the `find()` method of `std::string`.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a count variable to store the number of patterns that appear as substrings in the word.
2. Iterate over each pattern in the patterns array.
3. For each pattern, check if it is a substring of the word using the appropriate method based on the language.
4. If the pattern is a substring, increment the count.
5. Return the count as the final result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N*M), where N is the number of patterns and M is the length of the word.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String pattern : patterns) {
            if (word.contains(pattern)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfStrings(vector<string>& patterns, string word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (string pattern : patterns) {
            if (word.find(pattern) != string::npos) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numOfStrings(self, patterns: List[str], word: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern in word:
                count += 1
        return count
```
