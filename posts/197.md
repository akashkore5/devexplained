### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a self-join query on the Weather table to compare the temperature of each date with the temperature of the previous date. We can then select the rows where the temperature is higher than the temperature of the previous date.

### Algorithm:
1. Join the Weather table with itself on the condition where the recordDate of the first table is one day before the recordDate of the second table.
2. Select rows where the temperature of the second table is higher than the temperature of the first table.
3. Return the id of those rows.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Weather table.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra space other than the result table.

:

```java
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w2.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w2.recordDate, w1.recordDate) = 1
AND w2.temperature > w1.temperature;
```

```cpp
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w2.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w2.recordDate, w1.recordDate) = 1
AND w2.temperature > w1.temperature;
```

```python
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w2.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w2.recordDate, w1.recordDate) = 1
AND w2.temperature > w1.temperature;
```
