## Explanation
To maximize the sum of the matrix's elements, we need to manipulate the negative values in the matrix. We can do this by multiplying adjacent elements by -1. The key insight is that multiplying a negative number by -1 will make it positive, which will increase the overall sum.

To maximize the sum, we follow these steps:
1. Count the number of negative numbers and the absolute sum of all numbers in the matrix.
2. If there are an odd number of negative numbers, we can make all but one of them positive to maximize the sum.
3. If there are an even number of negative numbers, we can make all of them positive to maximize the sum.
4. If there are zeros, we can simply make them positive as they don't affect the sum.

This algorithm ensures that we maximize the sum by making the necessary adjustments to the negative numbers in the matrix.

Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the size of the matrix
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public long maxMatrixSum(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        long sum = 0;
        int minAbs = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int countNegatives = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int num = matrix[i][j];
                sum += Math.abs(num);
                minAbs = Math.min(minAbs, Math.abs(num));
                if (num < 0) {
                    countNegatives++;
                }
            }
        }

        if (countNegatives % 2 == 0) {
            return sum;
        } else {
            return sum - 2 * minAbs;
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long maxMatrixSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        long long sum = 0;
        int minAbs = INT_MAX;
        int countNegatives = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int num = matrix[i][j];
                sum += abs(num);
                minAbs = min(minAbs, abs(num));
                if (num < 0) {
                    countNegatives++;
                }
            }
        }

        if (countNegatives % 2 == 0) {
            return sum;
        } else {
            return sum - 2 * minAbs;
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxMatrixSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(matrix)
        sum_val = 0
        min_abs = float('inf')
        count_negatives = 0

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                num = matrix[i][j]
                sum_val += abs(num)
                min_abs = min(min_abs, abs(num))
                if num < 0:
                    count_negatives += 1

        if count_negatives % 2 == 0:
            return sum_val
        else:
            return sum_val - 2 * min_abs
