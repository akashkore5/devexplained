## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find employees whose salary is less than $30,000 and whose manager has left the company. This can be achieved by joining the Employees table with itself on the manager_id column and then filtering the rows based on the given conditions.

1. Join the Employees table with itself on the manager_id column to find employees and their managers.
2. Filter the joined table to select employees whose salary is less than $30,000 and whose manager has left the company (manager_id is null in the joined table).
3. Return the employee_id of the filtered employees in ascending order.
