### Explanation
To find the greatest common divisor of the smallest and largest numbers in the given array, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to efficiently compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers. First, we find the smallest and largest numbers in the array. Then, we repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of these two numbers.

1. Find the smallest and largest numbers in the array.
2. Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of the smallest and largest numbers.

**Time Complexity:**  
Finding the smallest and largest numbers: O(n)  
Applying Euclidean algorithm: O(log(min(a, b))) where a and b are the smallest and largest numbers respectively.  
Overall time complexity: O(n + log(min(a, b)))

**Space Complexity:**  
We are not using any extra space apart from the input array.  
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int findGCD(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
        return gcd(min, max);
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findGCD(vector<int>& nums) {
        int minNum = INT_MAX, maxNum = INT_MIN;
        for (int num : nums) {
            minNum = min(minNum, num);
            maxNum = max(maxNum, num);
        }
        return gcd(minNum, maxNum);
    }
    
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findGCD(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_num = min(nums)
        max_num = max(nums)
        
        def gcd(a, b):
            while b:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a
        
        return gcd(min_num, max_num)
```
