## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum amount of money we can rob up to the ith house without alerting the police. We can define a DP array where dp[i] represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the ith house.

The key idea is to consider whether to rob the current house or not. If we choose to rob the current house, then the maximum amount we can rob up to the ith house is the money in the current house plus the maximum amount we could rob up to the (i-2)th house. This is because we cannot rob adjacent houses due to the security system. If we choose not to rob the current house, then the maximum amount we can rob up to the ith house is the same as the maximum amount we could rob up to the (i-1)th house.

We can then iterate through the houses and update the DP array accordingly. Finally, the answer will be the maximum amount of money we can rob up to the last house.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of houses.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the DP array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1]);
        }
        
        return dp[n-1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        
        vector<int> dp(n);
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1]);
        }
        
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1])
        
        return dp[n-1]
```
