## Explanation
To minimize the difference between the highest and lowest scores of any k students, we can sort the scores in non-decreasing order. Then, we iterate through the sorted scores and calculate the difference between the score at index i+k-1 and the score at index i. We keep track of the minimum difference found during this process.

Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of scores  
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length - k; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i <= nums.size() - k; i++) {
            minDiff = std::min(minDiff, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        min_diff = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            min_diff = min(min_diff, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i])
        return min_diff
```
