### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We need to keep track of the number of unique good subsequences ending with '0' and '1'. 

1. Create two variables to store the count of subsequences ending with '0' and '1'.
2. Traverse the binary string.
3. If the current character is '0', update the count of subsequences ending with '0' as the sum of the count of subsequences ending with '0' and '1' (since we can append '0' to any good subsequence ending with '0' or '1').
4. If the current character is '1', update the count of subsequences ending with '1' as the sum of the count of subsequences ending with '0' and '1' (similar to the case of '0').
5. Keep track of whether '0' and '1' have been encountered at least once.
6. If both '0' and '1' have been encountered, add 1 to the total count to account for the empty subsequence.

Finally, return the sum of subsequences ending with '0' and '1' along with the additional count if both '0' and '1' have been encountered.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the binary string.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(String binary) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        int endWith0 = 0;
        int endWith1 = 0;
        boolean has0 = false;
        boolean has1 = false;
        
        for (char c : binary.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0') {
                endWith0 = (endWith0 + endWith1) % MOD;
                has0 = true;
            } else {
                endWith1 = (endWith0 + endWith1 + 1) % MOD;
                has1 = true;
            }
        }
        
        return (endWith0 + endWith1 + (has0 && has1 ? 1 : 0)) % MOD;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(string binary) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        int endWith0 = 0;
        int endWith1 = 0;
        bool has0 = false;
        bool has1 = false;
        
        for (char c : binary) {
            if (c == '0') {
                endWith0 = (endWith0 + endWith1) % MOD;
                has0 = true;
            } else {
                endWith1 = (endWith0 + endWith1 + 1) % MOD;
                has1 = true;
            }
        }
        
        return (endWith0 + endWith1 + (has0 && has1 ? 1 : 0)) % MOD;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(self, binary: str) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        end_with_0 = 0
        end_with_1 = 0
        has_0 = False
        has_1 = False
        
        for c in binary:
            if c == '0':
                end_with_0, end_with_1 = (end_with_0 + end_with_1) % MOD, end_with_1
                has_0 = True
            else:
                end_with_0, end_with_1 = end_with_0, (end_with_0 + end_with_1 + 1) % MOD
                has_1 = True
        
        return (end_with_0 + end_with_1 + 1 if has_0 and has_1 else end_with_0 + end_with_1) % MOD
