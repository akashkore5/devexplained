## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each student's score for each school and find the cutoff score for that school. The cutoff score for a school is the score that separates the top K students from the rest. We can use a priority queue to keep track of the top K scores for each school. 

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize a hashmap to store the scores for each school.
2. Iterate through each student's score and update the hashmap.
3. For each school, use a priority queue to keep track of the top K scores.
4. Find the cutoff score for each school by extracting the Kth element from the priority queue.

The time complexity of this approach is O(NlogK), where N is the total number of students and K is the number of top scores we want to consider. The space complexity is O(N) to store the scores for each school.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] findCutoffScores(int[] scores, int[] schools, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, PriorityQueue<Integer>> schoolScores = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
            int school = schools[i];
            int score = scores[i];
            
            schoolScores.putIfAbsent(school, new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder()));
            schoolScores.get(school).offer(score);
        }
        
        int[] cutoffScores = new int[schoolScores.size()];
        int index = 0;
        
        for (int school : schoolScores.keySet()) {
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = schoolScores.get(school);
            
            while (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.poll();
            }
            
            cutoffScores[index++] = pq.peek();
        }
        
        return cutoffScores;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findCutoffScores(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& schools, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, priority_queue<int>> schoolScores;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < scores.size(); i++) {
            int school = schools[i];
            int score = scores[i];
            
            schoolScores[school].push(score);
        }
        
        vector<int> cutoffScores(schoolScores.size());
        int index = 0;
        
        for (auto& it : schoolScores) {
            priority_queue<int>& pq = it.second;
            
            while (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.pop();
            }
            
            cutoffScores[index++] = pq.top();
        }
        
        return cutoffScores;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import collections
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findCutoffScores(self, scores: List[int], schools: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        schoolScores = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for score, school in zip(scores, schools):
            heapq.heappush(schoolScores[school], score)
        
        cutoffScores = []
        
        for scores in schoolScores.values():
            while len(scores) > k:
                heapq.heappop(scores)
            
            cutoffScores.append(scores[0])
        
        return cutoffScores
```
