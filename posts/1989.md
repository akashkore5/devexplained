## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use two pointers approach. We iterate through the array of tags and maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, representing the start and end indices of the current valid sequence of tags. We also keep track of the number of tags caught so far. Whenever a 'X' tag is encountered, we update the number of tags caught by incrementing the difference between `end` and `start + 1`, and move the `start` pointer to the next position. If the number of tags caught exceeds the limit `k`, we move the `end` pointer to the next position until the number of tags caught is within the limit.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of tags in the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int catchMaximumAmountofTags(char[] tags, int k) {
        int n = tags.length;
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        int caught = 0;
        
        while (end < n) {
            if (tags[end] == 'X') {
                caught += end - start + 1;
                start = end + 1;
            }
            
            if (caught > k) {
                caught -= end - start + 1;
                start++;
            }
            
            end++;
        }
        
        return Math.min(caught, k);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int catchMaximumAmountofTags(vector<char>& tags, int k) {
        int n = tags.size();
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        int caught = 0;
        
        while (end < n) {
            if (tags[end] == 'X') {
                caught += end - start + 1;
                start = end + 1;
            }
            
            if (caught > k) {
                caught -= end - start + 1;
                start++;
            }
            
            end++;
        }
        
        return min(caught, k);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def catchMaximumAmountofTags(self, tags: List[str], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(tags)
        start = 0
        end = 0
        caught = 0
        
        while end < n:
            if tags[end] == 'X':
                caught += end - start + 1
                start = end + 1
            
            if caught > k:
                caught -= end - start + 1
                start += 1
            
            end += 1
        
        return min(caught, k)
```
