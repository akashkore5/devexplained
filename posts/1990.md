### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of experiments required to determine the threshold temperature using a binary search approach. We will perform binary search on the possible range of the threshold temperature based on the results of the experiments.

1. Initialize the left pointer to the minimum temperature in the range and the right pointer to the maximum temperature in the range.
2. Perform binary search by calculating the mid temperature between the left and right pointers.
3. Perform experiments with the mid temperature and update the left or right pointer based on the result.
4. Continue the binary search until the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.
5. The number of experiments performed will be the total number of iterations in the binary search.

Time Complexity: O(log n) where n is the range of temperatures
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
public int countExperiments(int[] temperatures, int threshold) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = temperatures.length - 1;
    int experiments = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        experiments++;
        if (temperatures[mid] < threshold) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return experiments;
}
```

```cpp
int countExperiments(vector<int>& temperatures, int threshold) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = temperatures.size() - 1;
    int experiments = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        experiments++;
        if (temperatures[mid] < threshold) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return experiments;
}
```

```python
def count_experiments(temperatures, threshold):
    left = 0
    right = len(temperatures) - 1
    experiments = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        experiments += 1
        if temperatures[mid] < threshold:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return experiments
```
