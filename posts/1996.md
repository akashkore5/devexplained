### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the characters' properties and determine if there exists another character with strictly greater attack and defense levels for each character. We can achieve this by sorting the characters based on decreasing attack and defense levels. Then, we iterate through the sorted characters and check if there is any character with both attack and defense levels strictly greater than the current character.

### Algorithm
1. Sort the characters in descending order of attack levels and, for characters with the same attack level, in descending order of defense levels.
2. Initialize a count variable to track the number of weak characters.
3. Iterate through the sorted characters and compare the current character's attack and defense levels with the maximum attack and defense levels encountered so far. If there exists a character with both attack and defense levels greater than the current character, increment the count.
4. Return the count as the number of weak characters.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of characters.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the sorted characters.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        Arrays.sort(properties, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) {
                return b[1] - a[1];
            }
            return b[0] - a[0];
        });
        
        int count = 0;
        int maxDefense = 0;
        
        for (int[] character : properties) {
            if (character[1] < maxDefense) {
                count++;
            }
            maxDefense = Math.max(maxDefense, character[1]);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWeakCharacters(vector<vector<int>>& properties) {
        sort(properties.begin(), properties.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) {
                return a[1] > b[1];
            }
            return a[0] > b[0];
        });
        
        int count = 0;
        int maxDefense = 0;
        
        for (const auto& character : properties) {
            if (character[1] < maxDefense) {
                count++;
            }
            maxDefense = max(maxDefense, character[1]);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, properties: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        properties.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], -x[1]))
        
        count = 0
        max_defense = 0
        
        for character in properties:
            if character[1] < max_defense:
                count += 1
            max_defense = max(max_defense, character[1])
        
        return count
```
