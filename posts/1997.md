### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of visiting rooms on each day based on the given rules until we have visited all the rooms. We keep track of the number of times each room has been visited and the current day. We iterate through the days, updating the room to be visited next based on whether the current room has been visited an odd or even number of times.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables: `n` as the number of rooms, `days` as the current day, `visited` array to keep track of visits to each room, and `mod` as 10^9 + 7.
2. Start visiting rooms from day 0, update the number of visits for each room, and determine the next room to visit based on the rules.
3. Continue visiting rooms until all rooms have been visited.
4. Return the first day where all rooms have been visited modulo `mod`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of rooms.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) for the visited array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(int[] nextVisit) {
        int n = nextVisit.length;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int[] visited = new int[n];
        long days = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            days = (days + nextVisit[i] + 1) % mod;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            visited[i + 1] = (int)((visited[i] + 2 + mod - nextVisit[i] - days + mod) % mod);
            days = (days + visited[i] + 2) % mod;
        }
        
        return (int)days;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(vector<int>& nextVisit) {
        int n = nextVisit.size();
        int mod = 1000000007;
        vector<int> visited(n);
        long days = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            days = (days + nextVisit[i] + 1) % mod;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            visited[i + 1] = (visited[i] + 2 + mod - nextVisit[i] - days + mod) % mod;
            days = (days + visited[i] + 2) % mod;
        }
        
        return days;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def firstDayBeenInAllRooms(self, nextVisit: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nextVisit)
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        visited = [0] * n
        days = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            days = (days + nextVisit[i] + 1) % mod
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            visited[i + 1] = (visited[i] + 2 + mod - nextVisit[i] - days + mod) % mod
            days = (days + visited[i] + 2) % mod
        
        return days
