## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore the grid. We will iterate through each cell in the grid and whenever we encounter a '1' (land), we will mark it as visited and perform a DFS to explore all adjacent land cells connected to it. By doing this, we can identify each island and count the total number of islands in the grid.

Detailed steps:
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. If the cell is unvisited and contains '1', increment the island count and perform DFS to mark all connected land cells as visited.
3. In the DFS function, recursively explore all adjacent land cells and mark them as visited.
4. Continue iterating through the grid until all cells have been visited.

**Time Complexity**: O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

**Space Complexity**: O(m*n) for the recursive stack space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp

public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
