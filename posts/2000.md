### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the given `word` string. If `ch` is not found, we do nothing and return the original `word`. Otherwise, we reverse the segment of `word` starting from index 0 up to the index of the first occurrence of `ch`. We can achieve this by using a two-pointer approach where one pointer iterates from the beginning of the string and the other pointer moves until we find the first occurrence of `ch`. Once we have the index, we reverse the substring using the two pointers.

- Start with two pointers `start` at 0 and `end` at -1.
- Iterate through the `word` until we find the first occurrence of `ch`.
- Reverse the substring from index 0 to the index of `ch`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the `word` string. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the characters of the `word` string.

```java
class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        int end = word.indexOf(ch);
        if (end == -1) {
            return word;
        }
        char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
        int start = 0;
        while (start < end) {
            char temp = chars[start];
            chars[start] = chars[end];
            chars[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return new String(chars);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        int end = word.find(ch);
        if (end == string::npos) {
            return word;
        }
        int start = 0;
        while (start < end) {
            swap(word[start], word[end]);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return word;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def reversePrefix(self, word: str, ch: str) -> str:
        end = word.find(ch)
        if end == -1:
            return word
        chars = list(word)
        start = 0
        while start < end:
            chars[start], chars[end] = chars[end], chars[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1
        return ''.join(chars)
```
