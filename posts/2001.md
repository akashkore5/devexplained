## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given rectangles and calculate the width-to-height ratio for each rectangle. We can store these ratios in a hashmap where the key is the ratio and the value is the count of rectangles with that specific ratio. For each ratio, we can calculate the number of pairs using the formula `n * (n-1) / 2`, where n is the count of rectangles with that ratio. Finally, we sum up all the pairs for each ratio to get the total number of interchangeable pairs.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap to store the count of rectangles with each ratio.
2. Iterate through the rectangles and calculate the width-to-height ratio for each rectangle.
3. Update the hashmap with the count of rectangles having that ratio.
4. For each ratio, calculate the number of pairs using the formula `n * (n-1) / 2`, where n is the count of rectangles with that ratio.
5. Sum up all the pairs for each ratio to get the total number of interchangeable pairs.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rectangles.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rectangles.
```java
class Solution {
    public long interchangeableRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        HashMap<Double, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        long count = 0;
        
        for (int[] rect : rectangles) {
            double ratio = (double) rect[0] / rect[1];
            map.put(ratio, map.getOrDefault(ratio, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int n : map.values()) {
            count += (long) n * (n - 1) / 2;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long interchangeableRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        unordered_map<double, int> map;
        long count = 0;
        
        for (auto& rect : rectangles) {
            double ratio = (double) rect[0] / rect[1];
            map[ratio] += 1;
        }
        
        for (auto& pair : map) {
            count += (long) pair.second * (pair.second - 1) / 2;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def interchangeableRectangles(self, rectangles: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        map = {}
        count = 0
        
        for rect in rectangles:
            ratio = rect[0] / rect[1]
            map[ratio] = map.get(ratio, 0) + 1
        
        for n in map.values():
            count += n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        return count
