### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We start by sorting the rides array based on the end points. Then, we iterate through each ride and calculate the maximum earnings we can achieve up to that ride. For each ride, we have two choices: either to pick up the passenger or not. If we pick up the passenger, we add the earnings from that ride to the maximum earnings we had up to the starting point of the ride. If we don't pick up the passenger, we simply update the maximum earnings using the previous ride.

After iterating through all rides, the maximum earnings will be the maximum value in our earnings array. We return that value as the result.

**Time Complexity**: O(nlogn) where n is the number of rides  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public long maxTaxiEarnings(int n, int[][] rides) {
        Arrays.sort(rides, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        long[] earnings = new long[n + 1];
        
        int rideIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            earnings[i] = earnings[i - 1];
            while (rideIndex < rides.length && rides[rideIndex][1] == i) {
                int start = rides[rideIndex][0];
                int end = rides[rideIndex][1];
                int tip = rides[rideIndex][2];
                earnings[i] = Math.max(earnings[i], earnings[start] + end - start + tip);
                rideIndex++;
            }
        }
        
        return earnings[n];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long maxTaxiEarnings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& rides) {
        sort(rides.begin(), rides.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        vector<long> earnings(n + 1, 0);
        int rideIndex = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            earnings[i] = earnings[i - 1];
            while (rideIndex < rides.size() && rides[rideIndex][1] == i) {
                int start = rides[rideIndex][0];
                int end = rides[rideIndex][1];
                int tip = rides[rideIndex][2];
                earnings[i] = max(earnings[i], earnings[start] + end - start + tip);
                rideIndex++;
            }
        }
        
        return earnings[n];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxTaxiEarnings(self, n: int, rides: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rides.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        earnings = [0] * (n + 1)
        rideIndex = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            earnings[i] = earnings[i - 1]
            while rideIndex < len(rides) and rides[rideIndex][1] == i:
                start, end, tip = rides[rideIndex]
                earnings[i] = max(earnings[i], earnings[start] + end - start + tip)
                rideIndex += 1
        
        return earnings[n]
