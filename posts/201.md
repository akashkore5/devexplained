## Explanation:
To find the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range [left, right], we need to analyze the binary representation of the left and right numbers. The idea is to find the common prefix of the binary representations of left and right. The bits that are different in the binary representations of left and right will eventually be zeroed out in the result.

1. Identify the common prefix of the binary representations of left and right.
2. Left-shift the common prefix by the number of bits that are different between left and right.

Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the maximum of left and right.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            count++;
        }
        return left << count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            count++;
        }
        return left << count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while left < right:
            left >>= 1
            right >>= 1
            count += 1
        return left << count
```
