### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array of operations and update the value of variable X based on the operation. For each operation, we check whether it increments or decrements X, and update X accordingly. Finally, we return the final value of X.

- Initialize X to 0.
- Iterate through the operations array.
- For each operation:
  - If it is "++X" or "X++", increment X by 1.
  - If it is "--X" or "X--", decrement X by 1.
- Return the final value of X.

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of operations in the array.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int X = 0;
        for (String op : operations) {
            if (op.equals("++X") || op.equals("X++")) {
                X++;
            } else {
                X--;
            }
        }
        return X;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int X = 0;
        for (string op : operations) {
            if (op == "++X" || op == "X++") {
                X++;
            } else {
                X--;
            }
        }
        return X;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        X = 0
        for op in operations:
            if op == "++X" or op == "X++":
                X += 1
            else:
                X -= 1
        return X
```
