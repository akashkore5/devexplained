### Explanation:

Given a list of buildings represented by their heights, the task is to find the average height of buildings in each segment. A segment is defined as a continuous subarray of the buildings.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each segment, calculate the average height of the buildings in that segment, and store the result in a list.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the average heights of each segment.
2. Iterate through each segment:
    - Calculate the sum of heights in the current segment.
    - Calculate the average height by dividing the sum by the number of buildings in the segment.
    - Append the average height to the result list.
3. Return the list of average heights.

Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of buildings in the input list.
Space complexity: O(1) excluding the space required for the output list.
:
```java
public List<Double> averageOfBuildings(int[] buildings) {
    List<Double> averages = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < buildings.length; i++) {
        double sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < buildings.length; j++) {
            sum += buildings[j];
            count++;
            averages.add(sum / count);
        }
    }
    return averages;
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
vector<double> averageOfBuildings(vector<int>& buildings) {
    vector<double> averages;
    for (int i = 0; i < buildings.size(); i++) {
        double sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < buildings.size(); j++) {
            sum += buildings[j];
            count++;
            averages.push_back(sum / count);
        }
    }
    return averages;
}
```

#### Python:
```python
def averageOfBuildings(buildings):
    averages = []
    for i in range(len(buildings)):
        _sum = 0
        count = 0
        for j in range(i, len(buildings)):
            _sum += buildings[j]
            count += 1
            averages.append(_sum / count)
    return averages
```
