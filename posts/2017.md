### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points that can be collected by the second robot at each cell. We iterate through the grid from left to right and top to bottom, calculating the maximum points the second robot can collect at each cell based on the choices made by the first robot. The optimal strategy for the first robot is to minimize the points left for the second robot to collect.

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size 2 x n to store the maximum points the second robot can collect at each cell.
2. Iterate through the grid from left to right and top to bottom:
   - At each cell (r, c), update `dp[r][c]` to be the maximum of:
     - The points in the current cell plus the maximum points the second robot can collect from the cell above (if not in the first row).
     - The points in the current cell plus the maximum points the second robot can collect from the cell on the left (if not in the first column).
3. The maximum points the second robot can collect will be in `dp[1][n-1]`.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of columns in the grid.
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the dynamic programming array.

```java
class Solution {
    public long gridGame(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid[0].length;
        long[][] dp = new long[2][n];
        
        dp[1][n-1] = grid[1][n-1];
        
        for (int r = 0; r < 2; r++) {
            for (int c = n - 2; c >= 0; c--) {
                dp[r][c] = grid[r][c] + Math.min(dp[r][c + 1], (r == 0) ? Long.MAX_VALUE : dp[r - 1][c]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[1][0];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long gridGame(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<long>> dp(2, vector<long>(n, 0));
        
        dp[1][n-1] = grid[1][n-1];
        
        for (int r = 0; r < 2; r++) {
            for (int c = n - 2; c >= 0; c--) {
                dp[r][c] = grid[r][c] + min(dp[r][c + 1], (r == 0) ? LONG_MAX : dp[r - 1][c]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[1][0];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def gridGame(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid[0])
        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(2)]
        
        dp[1][n-1] = grid[1][n-1]
        
        for r in range(2):
            for c in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                dp[r][c] = grid[r][c] + min(dp[r][c + 1], float('inf') if r == 0 else dp[r - 1][c])
        
        return dp[1][0]
```
