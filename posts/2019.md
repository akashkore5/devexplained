### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the given math expression using the specified order of operations and then compare the result with the answers submitted by the students. We can achieve this by simulating the evaluation process and then checking each student's answer against the correct result.

1. Evaluate the expression:
   - We iterate through the expression string and perform the multiplication operations first, followed by addition operations.
   - We maintain a stack to keep track of the intermediate results.
   
2. Compare student answers:
   - For each student's answer, we evaluate the expression and compare it with the correct result.
   - If the answer matches the correct result, the student gets 5 points.
   - If the answer could be interpreted as applying the operators in the wrong order but still yielding the correct result, the student gets 2 points.
   - Otherwise, the student gets 0 points.

3. Calculate the total points:
   - Sum up the points awarded to all students.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int scoreOfStudents(String s, int[] answers) {
        // Code in Java
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfStudents(string s, vector<int>& answers) {
        // Code in C++
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def scoreOfStudents(self, s: str, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        # Code in Python
```
