### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have encountered while calculating the sum of the squares of digits. If we encounter a number that we have already seen, it means we are in a cycle and the number is not happy. If we reach 1, the number is happy. We keep iterating this process until we reach either 1 or a number we have seen before.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an empty set to store seen numbers.
2. While the number is not 1 and the number is not in the set:
   - Calculate the sum of the squares of digits.
   - If the sum is 1, return true.
   - Otherwise, add the sum to the set and update the number.
3. If the number is not 1, return false.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) - Each step calculates the sum of squares of digits which involves log n digits in the number n.
**Space Complexity:** O(log n) - The space used by the set to store seen numbers.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        while (n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)) {
            seen.add(n);
            int sum = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                int digit = n % 10;
                sum += digit * digit;
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = sum;
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        while (n != 1 && seen.find(n) == seen.end()) {
            seen.insert(n);
            int sum = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                int digit = n % 10;
                sum += digit * digit;
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = sum;
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            total = 0
            while n:
                digit = n % 10
                total += digit * digit
                n //= 10
            n = total
            
        return n == 1
```
