### Explanation

The problem asks us to find the number of accounts that did not stream on any day. To solve this problem, we can iterate through each account and mark the days they streamed. After that, we count the number of accounts that did not stream on any day.

1. Create a set to store the days when accounts stream.
2. Iterate through each account and mark the days they streamed.
3. Iterate through the accounts again and check if they streamed on any day. If not, increment the count.
4. Return the count of accounts that did not stream on any day.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * d), where n is the number of accounts and d is the number of days.

**Space Complexity:** O(n * d) for the set storing the days each account streamed.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfAccountsThatDidNotStream(int[][] accounts) {
        Set<Integer> streamingDays = new HashSet<>();
        int n = accounts.length;
        
        for (int[] account : accounts) {
            for (int day : account) {
                streamingDays.add(day);
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] account : accounts) {
            boolean streamed = false;
            for (int day : account) {
                if (streamingDays.contains(day)) {
                    streamed = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!streamed) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAccountsThatDidNotStream(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        unordered_set<int> streamingDays;
        int n = accounts.size();
        
        for (auto& account : accounts) {
            for (int day : account) {
                streamingDays.insert(day);
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (auto& account : accounts) {
            bool streamed = false;
            for (int day : account) {
                if (streamingDays.count(day)) {
                    streamed = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!streamed) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

class Solution:
    def numberOfAccountsThatDidNotStream(self, accounts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        streaming_days = set()
        n = len(accounts)
        
        for account in accounts:

                    streamed = True
                    break
            if not streamed:
                count += 1
        
        return count
