### Explanation:
To maximize the number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window that contains the maximum number of 'T's or 'F's that can be achieved by changing at most 'k' answers. We will slide the window to the right and calculate the maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's that can be obtained.

1. Initialize variables: 
   - Set pointers left and right to 0.
   - Initialize maxCount to store the maximum length of consecutive 'T's or 'F's.

2. Iterate over the answer key:
   - If the difference between the current window size and the count of 'T's or 'F's in the window exceeds 'k', increment the left pointer.
   - Calculate the current maximum count of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the window.
   - Update maxCount with the maximum of current count and maxCount.
   - Increment the right pointer.

3. Return maxCount as the result.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutiveAnswers(String answerKey, int k) {
        int n = answerKey.length();
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxCount = 0;
        int[] count = new int[2]; // Store count of 'T's and 'F's
        char[] arr = answerKey.toCharArray();
        
        while (right < n) {
            count[arr[right] - 'T']++;
            if (Math.max(count[0], count[1]) + k < right - left + 1) {
                count[arr[left] - 'T']--;
                left++;
            }
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxConsecutiveAnswers(string answerKey, int k) {
        int n = answerKey.size();
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxCount = 0;
        vector<int> count(2, 0); // Store count of 'T's and 'F's

        while (right < n) {
            count[answerKey[right] - 'T']++;
            if (max(count[0], count[1]) + k < right - left + 1) {
                count[answerKey[left] - 'T']--;
                left++;
            }
            maxCount = max(maxCount, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }

        return maxCount;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxConsecutiveAnswers(self, answerKey: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(answerKey)
        left = 0
        maxCount = 0
        count = [0, 0]  # Store count of 'T's and 'F's

        for right in range(n):
            count[ord(answerKey[right]) - ord('T')] += 1
            if max(count) + k < right - left + 1:
                count[ord(answerKey[left]) - ord('T')] -= 1
                left += 1
            maxCount = max(maxCount, right - left + 1)

        return maxCount
```
