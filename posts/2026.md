## Explanation:
This problem can be solved by iterating through the given array and checking if each element is below a certain quality threshold. We can count the number of low-quality elements and return the count as the result.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of low-quality elements.
2. Iterate through the input array.
3. For each element, check if it is less than the given quality threshold.
4. If the element is below the quality threshold, increment the `count` variable.
5. After iterating through all elements, return the `count` as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

:
:
```java
public int countLowQualityProblems(int[] problems, int threshold) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int problem : problems) {
        if (problem < threshold) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
int countLowQualityProblems(vector<int>& problems, int threshold) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int problem : problems) {
        if (problem < threshold) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Python:
```python
def count_low_quality_problems(problems, threshold):
    count = 0
    for problem in problems:
        if problem < threshold:
            count += 1
    return count
```
