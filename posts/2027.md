### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of 'X' characters in the input string and then calculate the minimum number of moves required to convert all 'X' characters to 'O'.

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of 'X' characters.
2. Iterate through the input string and count the number of 'X' characters.
3. The minimum number of moves required is the total count of 'X' characters divided by 3 (since each move converts 3 consecutive characters to 'O').
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(String s) {
        int countX = 0;
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if(c == 'X') {
                countX++;
            }
        }
        return countX / 3;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(string s) {
        int countX = 0;
        for(char c : s) {
            if(c == 'X') {
                countX++;
            }
        }
        return countX / 3;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumMoves(self, s: str) -> int:
        countX = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == 'X':
                countX += 1
        return countX // 3
```
