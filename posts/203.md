### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the linked list while checking if the current node's value matches the given value `val`. If it does, we skip that node by adjusting the pointers. We continue this process until we reach the end of the linked list. We need to handle the cases where the head node itself needs to be removed, in which case we move the head pointer to the next node.

- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        while (head != null && head.val == val) {
            head = head.next;
        }
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            if (current.next.val == val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

```cpp
ListNode* removeElements(ListNode* head, int val) {
    while (head != NULL && head->val == val) {
        head = head->next;
    }
    ListNode* current = head;
    while (current != NULL && current->next != NULL) {
        if (current->next->val == val) {
            current->next = current->next->next;
        } else {
            current = current->next;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: ListNode, val: int) -> ListNode:
        while head and head.val == val:
            head = head.next
        current = head
        while current and current.next:
            if current.next.val == val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next
        return head
```
