## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will iterate through the string `s` and maintain a window of size `k`. At each step, we will check if the current window contains the required number of occurrences of the given letter. If it does, we will update our result with the lexicographically smallest subsequence found so far.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `left` and `right` to 0 to represent the window boundaries.
2. Initialize a hashmap `letterCount` to store the count of each letter in the window.
3. Initialize variables `minSubseq` and `minString` to store the smallest subsequence found so far and its corresponding string.
4. Iterate through the string `s`:
   - Increment the count of the current letter in the window.
   - Increment `right` to expand the window.
   - If the window size exceeds `k`, increment `left` and update the count of the letter accordingly.
   - Check if the current window contains at least `repetition` occurrences of the given letter:
     - If yes, update `minSubseq` and `minString` with the lexicographically smallest subsequence found.
5. Return `minSubseq`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) since we are using a fixed-size hashmap to store letter counts.
```java
class Solution {
    public String smallestSubsequence(String s, int k, char letter, int repetition) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, count = 0;
        int[] letterCount = new int[26];
        String minSubseq = "";
        String minString = "";
        
        for (right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            if (s.charAt(right) == letter) {
                count++;
            }
            letterCount[s.charAt(right) - 'a']++;
            
            while (right - left + 1 > k) {
                if (s.charAt(left) == letter) {
                    count--;
                }
                letterCount[s.charAt(left) - 'a']--;
                left++;
            }
            
            if (count >= repetition && (minSubseq.equals("") || s.substring(left, right + 1).compareTo(minString) < 0)) {
                minSubseq = s.substring(left, right + 1);
                minString = minSubseq;
            }
        }
        
        return minSubseq;
    }
}

        string minSubseq = "";
        string minString = "";

                count++;
            }
            letterCount[s[right] - 'a']++;
            
            while (right - left + 1 > k) {
                if (s[left] == letter) {
                    count--;
                }
                letterCount[s[left] - 'a']--;

            }
            
            if (count >= repetition && (minSubseq.empty() || s.substr(left, right - left + 1) < minString)) {
                minSubseq = s.substr(left, right - left + 1);
                minString = minSubseq;
            }
        }
        
        return minSubseq;
