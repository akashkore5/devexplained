### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to minimize the total moves required to seat each student such that no two students are in the same seat. We can achieve this by sorting the arrays `seats` and `students`, then calculating the total moves needed based on the distance between the positions in the sorted arrays.

1. Sort the `seats` and `students` arrays.
2. Initialize a variable `totalMoves` to 0.
3. Iterate over each student and calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding seat position and the student position.
4. Add this difference to `totalMoves`.
5. Return `totalMoves`.
:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);

        int totalMoves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            totalMoves += Math.abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }

        return totalMoves;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& seats, vector<int>& students) {
        sort(seats.begin(), seats.end());
        sort(students.begin(), students.end());

        int totalMoves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {
            totalMoves += abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
        }

        return totalMoves;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minMovesToSeat(self, seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
        seats.sort()
        students.sort()

        total_moves = 0
        for i in range(len(seats)):
            total_moves += abs(seats[i] - students[i])

        return total_moves
```
