## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the passing of messages between servers and track the time when the network becomes idle. We need to keep track of the messages sent by each data server, their arrival time at the master server, and the patience of each data server for resending messages.

1. Create a graph representation using the given edges.
2. Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the next message arrival time at each server.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current time.
4. Start iterating from the beginning of the simulation:
   - Process the next message arrival at the master server.
   - Update the patience timer for each data server.
   - Resend messages from data servers if the patience timer has elapsed.
   - Update the priority queue with the next message arrival times.

The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers. We need to find the earliest second when this happens.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of servers (nodes) in the network.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the messages in the priority queue.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int secondBest(int[][] edges, int[] patience) {
        // Java solution
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int secondBest(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& patience) {
        // C++ solution
        // Your code here
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def secondBest(self, edges: List[List[int]], patience: List[int]) -> int:
        # Python solution
        # Your code here
```
