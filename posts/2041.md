## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of candidates and interviews and keep track of the accepted candidates. We will use a hashmap to store the count of accepted candidates for each company. Then, we will iterate through the hashmap to find the company with the maximum number of accepted candidates.

- Create a hashmap to store the count of accepted candidates for each company.
- Iterate through the list of candidates and interviews.
- For each candidate, check if they have passed the interview.
- If the candidate has passed the interview, increment the count of accepted candidates for the corresponding company in the hashmap.
- After iterating through all candidates, find the company with the maximum number of accepted candidates.
- Return the company with the maximum number of accepted candidates.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the total number of candidates.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(m), where m is the number of unique companies.
```java
class Solution {
    public String findAcceptedCompany(String[] candidates, String[] interviews) {
        Map<String, Integer> acceptedCandidates = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            if (interviews[i].equals("Accepted")) {
                String company = candidates[i];
                acceptedCandidates.put(company, acceptedCandidates.getOrDefault(company, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        String maxCompany = "";
        int maxCount = 0;
        
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : acceptedCandidates.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > maxCount) {
                maxCount = entry.getValue();
                maxCompany = entry.getKey();
            }
        }
        
        return maxCompany;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findAcceptedCompany(vector<string>& candidates, vector<string>& interviews) {
        unordered_map<string, int> acceptedCandidates;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < candidates.size(); i++) {
            if (interviews[i] == "Accepted") {
                string company = candidates[i];
                acceptedCandidates[company]++;
            }
        }
        
        string maxCompany = "";
        int maxCount = 0;
        
        for (auto& entry : acceptedCandidates) {
            if (entry.second > maxCount) {
                maxCount = entry.second;
                maxCompany = entry.first;
            }
        }
        
        return maxCompany;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findAcceptedCompany(self, candidates: List[str], interviews: List[str]) -> str:
        accepted_candidates = {}
        
        for i in range(len(candidates)):
            if interviews[i] == "Accepted":
                company = candidates[i]
                accepted_candidates[company] = accepted_candidates.get(company, 0) + 1
        
        max_company = ""
        max_count = 0
        
        for company, count in accepted_candidates.items():
            if count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                max_company = company
        
        return max_company
