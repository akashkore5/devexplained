## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can model the situation as a graph traversal problem where we need to find the second minimum time to reach the destination vertex n starting from vertex 1. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the graph. 

We need to consider the effect of the traffic signals while traversing the graph. We can maintain two distances for each vertex: one for the current time and one for the time when the signal changes. This way, we can consider the waiting time at each vertex when the signal is red.

The algorithm involves iterating through the vertices and edges while considering the time taken to reach each vertex, waiting time at each vertex, and the time to change the signal.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(NlogN) where N is the number of vertices in the graph. The space complexity is O(N).

            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{edge[1], time});
            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[1], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{edge[0], time});
        }
        
        int[][] dist = new int[n + 1][change + 1];
