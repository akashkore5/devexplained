### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can perform a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the score of each node. We will calculate the score recursively by considering the sizes of all subtrees rooted at the children of the current node. After calculating the score of each node, we can determine the highest score and count the nodes with that score.

- Perform a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the score of each node.
- Calculate the score of a node by multiplying the sizes of all subtrees rooted at its children.
- Keep track of the highest score encountered and count the nodes with that score.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countHighestScoreNodes(int[] parents) {
        int n = parents.length;
        int[] score = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(score, 1);

        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            score[parents[i]] *= (1 + score[i]);
        }

        int highestScore = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int s : score) {
            highestScore = Math.max(highestScore, s);
        }

        for (int s : score) {
            if (s == highestScore) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countHighestScoreNodes(vector<int>& parents) {
        int n = parents.size();
        vector<int> score(n, 1);

        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            score[parents[i]] *= (1 + score[i]);
        }

        int highestScore = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int s : score) {
            highestScore = max(highestScore, s);
        }

        for (int s : score) {
            if (s == highestScore) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countHighestScoreNodes(self, parents: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(parents)
        score = [1] * n

        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            score[parents[i]] *= (1 + score[i])

        highest_score = max(score)
        count = score.count(highest_score)

        return count
```
