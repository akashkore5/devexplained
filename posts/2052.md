### Explanation:
Given a sentence and a maximum column width, we need to separate the sentence into rows such that each row does not exceed the column width. The cost of a row is calculated as the square of the extra spaces at the end of the row. The total cost is the sum of costs for all rows.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We iterate through each word in the sentence and try to fit as many words as possible in a row without exceeding the column width. At each step, we calculate the cost of the current row and update the minimum cost for reaching that word.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCostToSeparateSentenceIntoRows(String sentence, int columnWidth) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        int n = words.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int remainingWidth = columnWidth - words[i - 1].length();
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + remainingWidth * remainingWidth;

            for (int j = i - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                remainingWidth -= (words[j].length() + 1); // +1 for space
                if (remainingWidth < 0) break;
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + remainingWidth * remainingWidth);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCostToSeparateSentenceIntoRows(string sentence, int columnWidth) {
        vector<string> words;
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }

        int n = words.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int remainingWidth = columnWidth - words[i - 1].length();
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + remainingWidth * remainingWidth;

            for (int j = i - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                remainingWidth -= (words[j].length() + 1); // +1 for space
                if (remainingWidth < 0) break;
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + remainingWidth * remainingWidth);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumCostToSeparateSentenceIntoRows(self, sentence: str, columnWidth: int) -> int:
        words = sentence.split()
        n = len(words)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            remainingWidth = columnWidth - len(words[i - 1])
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + remainingWidth * remainingWidth

            for j in range(i - 2, -1, -1):
                remainingWidth -= len(words[j]) + 1  # +1 for space
                if remainingWidth < 0:
                    break
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + remainingWidth * remainingWidth)

        return dp[n]
```
