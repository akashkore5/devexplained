## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We start with the `start` value and explore all possible operations using the numbers in the `nums` array. We keep track of the number of operations needed to reach each possible value of `x` using a map. We continue exploring until we find the `goal` value or until we exhaust all possibilities.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a map to store the minimum operations needed to reach each value of `x`.
2. Initialize a queue for BFS and add the `start` value to the queue with 0 operations.
3. Perform BFS by popping values from the queue and exploring all possible operations using the numbers in the `nums` array.
4. Update the minimum operations needed to reach each new value of `x` in the map.
5. Continue until we find the `goal` value or exhaust all possibilities.
6. Return the minimum operations needed to reach `goal` from `start`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N * M), where N is the number of elements in the `nums` array and M is the maximum possible value of `x` (1000 in this case).

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(M) to store the minimum operations for each possible value of `x`.

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> operations = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        operations.put(start, 0);
        queue.offer(start);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = queue.poll();
            int ops = operations.get(curr);
            
            if (curr == goal) {
                return ops;
            }
            
            for (int num : nums) {
                int next1 = curr + num;
                int next2 = curr - num;
                int next3 = curr ^ num;
                
                if (!operations.containsKey(next1)) {
                    operations.put(next1, ops + 1);
                    queue.offer(next1);
                }
                if (!operations.containsKey(next2)) {
                    operations.put(next2, ops + 1);
                    queue.offer(next2);

                    operations.put(next3, ops + 1);
