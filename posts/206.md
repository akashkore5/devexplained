### Explanation
To reverse a linked list, we can iterate through the list while reversing the pointers to point in the opposite direction. We need to keep track of the current node, the next node, and the previous node to perform the reversal.

1. **Iterative Approach:**
   - Initialize three pointers: `prev` as null, `curr` as the head of the list, and `next` as null.
   - Traverse the list while updating the pointers: set `next` to `curr.next`, point `curr.next` to `prev`, move `prev` to `curr`, and move `curr` to `next`.
   - Return `prev` as the new head of the reversed list.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - The base case is when the current node is null or the next node is null, return the current node.
   - Recursively call the function on the next node, then reverse the pointers by setting `curr.next.next` to `curr` and set `curr.next` to null.
   - Return the new head of the reversed list.
  
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space Complexity: O(1) for the iterative approach and O(n) for the recursive approach due to the stack space used in recursion.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        ListNode next = null;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        
        return prev;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        ListNode* next = nullptr;
        
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        
        return prev;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node
        
        return prev
```
