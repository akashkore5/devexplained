### Explanation:

The problem requires us to determine the number of spaces cleaned by a cleaning robot based on its movement instructions. The cleaning robot starts at position `(0,0)` in a grid and moves according to the given instructions. The robot can move up, down, left, or right by one unit at a time.

To solve this problem, we can simulate the movement of the cleaning robot and keep track of the spaces cleaned. We will maintain a set to store the coordinates of the spaces cleaned during the robot's movement.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a set to store the coordinates of the spaces cleaned.
2. Initialize the robot's position as `(0,0)`.
3. Iterate through each movement instruction:
    - Update the robot's position based on the instruction.
    - Add the new position to the set of cleaned spaces.
4. Return the size of the set, which represents the number of spaces cleaned.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of movement instructions given.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of unique spaces cleaned during the robot's movement.

class Solution {
    public int numberofSpacesCleaned(String instructions) {
        Set<String> cleanedSpaces = new HashSet<>();
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        
        cleanedSpaces.add("0,0");
        
        for (char instruction : instructions.toCharArray()) {
            switch(instruction) {
                case 'U':
                    y++;
                    break;
                case 'D':
                    y--;
                    break;
