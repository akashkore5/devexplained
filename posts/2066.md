## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to keep track of each account's balance. We will iterate through each transaction and update the balance for both the sender and receiver accordingly. Finally, we can iterate through the hashmap and return the account balances.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap `balances` to store the balance of each account.
2. Iterate through each transaction:
   - Decrement the sender's balance by the transaction amount.
   - Increment the receiver's balance by the transaction amount.
3. Iterate through the hashmap `balances` and add the account balances to a list.
4. Return the list of account balances.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of transactions.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of unique accounts.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> accountBalances(List<List<Integer>> transactions) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> balances = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (List<Integer> transaction : transactions) {
            int sender = transaction.get(0);
            int receiver = transaction.get(1);
            int amount = transaction.get(2);
            
            balances.put(sender, balances.getOrDefault(sender, 0) - amount);
            balances.put(receiver, balances.getOrDefault(receiver, 0) + amount);
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int balance : balances.values()) {
            result.add(balance);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> accountBalances(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        unordered_map<int, int> balances;
        
        for (const auto& transaction : transactions) {
            int sender = transaction[0];
            int receiver = transaction[1];
            int amount = transaction[2];
            
            balances[sender] -= amount;
            balances[receiver] += amount;
        }
        
        vector<int> result;
        for (const auto& balance : balances) {
            result.push_back(balance.second);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def accountBalances(self, transactions: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        balances = {}
        
        for transaction in transactions:
            sender, receiver, amount = transaction
            
            balances[sender] = balances.get(sender, 0) - amount
            balances[receiver] = balances.get(receiver, 0) + amount
        
        result = list(balances.values())
        
        return result
```
