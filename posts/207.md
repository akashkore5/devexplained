## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can model the courses and prerequisites as a graph where each course is a node and each prerequisite relationship is a directed edge. We need to check if there is a cycle in the graph, as a cycle would indicate a situation where it is impossible to complete all courses.

We can use a topological sorting algorithm, specifically Kahn's algorithm, to detect cycles in a directed graph. The key idea is to iteratively remove nodes with zero in-degree (no prerequisites) from the graph, updating the in-degrees of remaining nodes. If at the end all nodes have been removed, then there is no cycle and it is possible to complete all courses.

### Algorithm:
1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph using the prerequisites array.
2. Initialize an array `inDegrees` to store the in-degree of each course.
3. Initialize a queue and add all courses with in-degree 0 to the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty, remove a course from the queue, decrement the in-degrees of its neighbors, and if any neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
5. After processing all courses, if the count of courses processed is equal to numCourses, return true (no cycles). Otherwise, return false.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (vertices) and E is the number of prerequisites (edges).

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V + E) as well, considering the adjacency list and inDegrees array.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] inDegrees = new int[numCourses];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
            graph.get(pre[1]).add(pre[0]);
            inDegrees[pre[0]]++;
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (inDegrees[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }
