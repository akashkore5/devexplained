### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the tasks and workers arrays in descending order.
2. For each task, try to assign a worker with the highest strength possible. If a worker can't meet the task's strength requirement, check if giving them a magical pill would make them eligible.
3. Keep track of the number of tasks that can be completed.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the maximum of the lengths of tasks and workers arrays.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTasks(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int pills, int strength) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        Arrays.sort(workers);
        
        int tasksCompleted = 0;
        int workerIdx = 0;
        
        for (int task : tasks) {
            while (workerIdx < workers.length && workers[workerIdx] < task) {
                if (pills > 0 && workers[workerIdx] + strength >= task) {
                    pills--;
                    workerIdx++;
                    tasksCompleted++;
                } else {
                    workerIdx++;
                }
            }
            if (workerIdx < workers.length && workers[workerIdx] >= task) {
                workerIdx++;
                tasksCompleted++;
            }
        }
        
        return tasksCompleted;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTasks(vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength) {
        sort(tasks.rbegin(), tasks.rend());
        sort(workers.rbegin(), workers.rend());
        
        int tasksCompleted = 0;
        int workerIdx = 0;
        
        for (int task : tasks) {
            while (workerIdx < workers.size() && workers[workerIdx] < task) {
                if (pills > 0 && workers[workerIdx] + strength >= task) {
                    pills--;
                    workerIdx++;
                    tasksCompleted++;
                } else {
                    workerIdx++;
                }
            }
            if (workerIdx < workers.size() && workers[workerIdx] >= task) {
                workerIdx++;
                tasksCompleted++;
            }
        }
        
        return tasksCompleted;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxTasks(self, tasks: List[int], workers: List[int], pills: int, strength: int) -> int:
        tasks.sort(reverse=True)
        workers.sort(reverse=True)
        
        tasksCompleted = 0
        workerIdx = 0
        
        for task in tasks:
            while workerIdx < len(workers) and workers[workerIdx] < task:
                if pills > 0 and workers[workerIdx] + strength >= task:
                    pills -= 1
                    workerIdx += 1
                    tasksCompleted += 1
                else:
                    workerIdx += 1
            if workerIdx < len(workers) and workers[workerIdx] >= task:

                tasksCompleted += 1
