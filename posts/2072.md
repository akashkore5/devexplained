## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the count of votes for each candidate. We iterate through the list of votes, updating the count for each candidate in the hashmap. Finally, we find the candidate with the highest count to determine the winner.

- Initialize a hashmap to store the count of votes for each candidate.
- Iterate through the list of votes and update the count for each candidate in the hashmap.
- Find the candidate with the highest count to determine the winner.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of votes  
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of votes
```java
class Solution {
    public String findWinner(String[] votes) {
        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        String winner = "";
        int maxVotes = 0;
        
        for (String vote : votes) {
            count.put(vote, count.getOrDefault(vote, 0) + 1);
            if (count.get(vote) > maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = count.get(vote);
                winner = vote;
            } else if (count.get(vote) == maxVotes && vote.compareTo(winner) < 0) {
                winner = vote;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findWinner(vector<string>& votes) {
        unordered_map<string, int> count;
        string winner = "";
        int maxVotes = 0;
        
        for (string vote : votes) {
            count[vote]++;
            if (count[vote] > maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = count[vote];
                winner = vote;
            } else if (count[vote] == maxVotes && vote < winner) {
                winner = vote;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findWinner(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        count = {}
        winner = ""
        maxVotes = 0
        
        for vote in votes:
            count[vote] = count.get(vote, 0) + 1
            if count[vote] > maxVotes:
                maxVotes = count[vote]
                winner = vote
            elif count[vote] == maxVotes and vote < winner:
                winner = vote
        
        return winner
