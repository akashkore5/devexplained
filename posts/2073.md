## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of people buying tickets in a queue. We iterate through the queue, decrementing the number of tickets each person wants to buy and moving them to the end of the queue if they still have tickets left. We keep track of the time taken until the person at position `k` has bought all their tickets.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a queue to represent the line of people.
2. Iterate through the queue:
   - Decrement the number of tickets the person wants to buy.
   - If the person still has tickets left, move them to the end of the queue.
   - Increment the time taken.
   - If the person at position `k` has bought all their tickets, return the time taken.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * max(tickets)), where n is the number of people in the queue and max(tickets) is the maximum number of tickets any person wants to buy.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the queue of people.
```java
class Solution {
    public int buyTicketTime(int[] tickets, int k) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {
            queue.add(tickets[i]);
        }

        int time = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int front = queue.poll();
            time++;
            if (front > 1) {
                queue.add(front - 1);
            }
            if (k == 0) {
                if (front == 1) {
                    return time;
                }
            } else {
                k = (k + queue.size()) % queue.size();
            }
        }

        return time;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int buyTicketTime(vector<int>& tickets, int k) {
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < tickets.size(); i++) {
            q.push(tickets[i]);
        }

        int time = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int front = q.front();
            q.pop();
            time++;
            if (front > 1) {
                q.push(front - 1);
            }
            if (k == 0) {
                if (front == 1) {
                    return time;
                }
            } else {
                k = (k + q.size()) % q.size();
            }
        }

        return time;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def buyTicketTime(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        queue = deque(tickets)
        time = 0
        while queue:
            front = queue.popleft()
            time += 1
            if front > 1:
                queue.append(front - 1)
            if k == 0:
                if front == 1:
                    return time
            else:
                k = (k + len(queue)) % len(queue)
        
        return time
```
