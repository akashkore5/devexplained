### Explanation
To solve this problem efficiently, we can simulate the process of watering the plants while keeping track of the steps taken. We start at the river with a full watering can, then iterate through the plants from left to right. For each plant, we check if we have enough water in the can to water it completely. If not, we return to the river to refill the can and continue watering the remaining plants.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize variables `steps` to 0, `currWater` to the capacity, and `currPos` to -1 (indicating the river).
2. Iterate through the plants:
   a. Calculate the steps needed to water the current plant.
   b. If `currWater` is not enough, return to the river and refill the can, updating `steps`.
   c. Water the current plant and update `currWater`.
3. Return the total steps taken.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of plants.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(int[] plants, int capacity) {
        int steps = 0;
        int currWater = capacity;
        int currPos = -1;
        
        for (int plant : plants) {
            int stepsNeeded = Math.abs(currPos - plant) + 1;
            
            if (stepsNeeded > currWater) {
                steps += Math.abs(currPos - (-1)) + 1; // return to river
                currWater = capacity;
            }
            
            steps += stepsNeeded;
            currWater -= stepsNeeded;
            currPos = plant;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(vector<int>& plants, int capacity) {
        int steps = 0;
        int currWater = capacity;
        int currPos = -1;
        
        for (int plant : plants) {
            int stepsNeeded = abs(currPos - plant) + 1;
            
            if (stepsNeeded > currWater) {
                steps += abs(currPos - (-1)) + 1; // return to river
                currWater = capacity;
            }
            
            steps += stepsNeeded;
            currWater -= stepsNeeded;
            currPos = plant;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, plants: List[int], capacity: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        currWater = capacity
        currPos = -1
        
        for plant in plants:
            stepsNeeded = abs(currPos - plant) + 1
            
            if stepsNeeded > currWater:
                steps += abs(currPos - (-1)) + 1 # return to river
                currWater = capacity
            
            steps += stepsNeeded
            currWater -= stepsNeeded
            currPos = plant
        
        return steps
```
