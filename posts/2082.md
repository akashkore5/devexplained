## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each customer and check if their wealth is greater than or equal to a given threshold. We will keep a count of the rich customers and return this count at the end.

1. Initialize a variable `richCount` to 0.
2. Iterate through each customer's wealth.
3. If the wealth of the customer is greater than or equal to the threshold, increment the `richCount`.
4. Finally, return the `richCount`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of customers.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numRichCustomers(int[][] accounts, int threshold) {
        int richCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int wealth = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                wealth += accounts[i][j];
            }
            if (wealth >= threshold) {
                richCount++;
            }
        }
        return richCount;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRichCustomers(vector<vector<int>>& accounts, int threshold) {
        int richCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.size(); i++) {
            int wealth = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].size(); j++) {
                wealth += accounts[i][j];
            }
            if (wealth >= threshold) {
                richCount++;
            }
        }
        return richCount;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def numRichCustomers(self, accounts: List[List[int]], threshold: int) -> int:
        richCount = 0
        for account in accounts:
            wealth = sum(account)
            if wealth >= threshold:
                richCount += 1
        return richCount
```
