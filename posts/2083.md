### Explanation:

Given a string, we need to find the number of substrings that begin and end with the same letter. We can achieve this by iterating through the string and counting the occurrences of each character. For each character, we can determine the number of substrings that begin and end with that character by multiplying the count of occurrences of that character by one less than that count and then dividing by 2. This is because for each character, we can form substrings by selecting the starting and ending positions in different ways.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize a count variable to store the total count of substrings that begin and end with the same letter.
2. Iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each character.
3. For each character, add the count of occurrences multiplied by one less than that count, and then divide by 2 to get the total number of substrings that begin and end with that character.
4. Return the total count of substrings.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
            int charCount = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == c) {
                    charCount++;
                }
            }
            
            count += (charCount * (charCount - 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
            int charCount = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
                if (s[i] == c) {
                    charCount++;
                }
            }
            
            count += (charCount * (charCount - 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            char_count = 0
            for i in range(len(s)):
                if s[i] == chr(c):
                    char_count += 1
            
            count += (char_count * (char_count - 1)) // 2
        
        return count
```
