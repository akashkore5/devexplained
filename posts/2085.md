### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through both input arrays `words1` and `words2` and count the frequency of each word in each array using HashMaps. Then, we can iterate through the words in both arrays and check if a word appears exactly once in each array. If it does, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter as the result.

- Create HashMaps to store the frequency of words in `words1` and `words2`.
- Iterate through both arrays and count the frequency of words.
- Iterate through the words in both arrays and check if a word appears exactly once in each array.
- Increment a counter for each word that meets the condition.
- Return the counter as the result.

Time complexity: O(m + n) where m is the size of words1 and n is the size of words2.
Space complexity: O(m + n) for storing the frequency of words in both arrays.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int countCommonWords(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> freq1 = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<String, Integer> freq2 = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String word : words1) {
            freq1.put(word, freq1.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (String word : words2) {
            freq2.put(word, freq2.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (String word : freq1.keySet()) {
            if (freq1.get(word) == 1 && freq2.getOrDefault(word, 0) == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int countCommonWords(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
        unordered_map<string, int> freq1;
        unordered_map<string, int> freq2;
        
        for (string word : words1) {
            freq1[word]++;
        }
        
        for (string word : words2) {
            freq2[word]++;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (auto& entry : freq1) {
            if (entry.second == 1 && freq2[entry.first] == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countCommonWords(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> int:
        freq1 = {}
        freq2 = {}
        
        for word in words1:
            freq1[word] = freq1.get(word, 0) + 1
        
        for word in words2:
            freq2[word] = freq2.get(word, 0) + 1
        
        count = 0
        for word in freq1:
            if freq1[word] == 1 and freq2.get(word, 0) == 1:
                count += 1
        
        return count
