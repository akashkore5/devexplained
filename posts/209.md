### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer sliding window approach. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the start of the array. We keep expanding the window by moving the `right` pointer until the sum of the subarray between `left` and `right` is less than the target. Once the sum is greater than or equal to the target, we update the minimum length found so far and move the `left` pointer to shrink the window while keeping the sum greater than or equal to the target. We continue this process until we reach the end of the array.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while (right < n) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while (sum >= target) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            right++;
        }

        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int minLength = INT_MAX;

        while (right < n) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while (sum >= target) {
                minLength = min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            right++;
        }

        return minLength == INT_MAX ? 0 : minLength;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        left = 0
        right = 0
        sum_val = 0
        min_length = float('inf')

        while right < n:
            sum_val += nums[right]
            while sum_val >= target:
                min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
                sum_val -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            right += 1

        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```
