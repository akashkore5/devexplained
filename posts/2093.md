### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm with a slight modification. We will create a graph where each node represents a city and each edge represents a flight between two cities. We will keep track of the cost to reach each city with and without the discount.

1. Initialize a priority queue to store the cities with their current cost.
2. Initialize two arrays, `cost` and `discountCost`, to store the minimum cost to reach each city without and with a discount, respectively. Initialize all values in both arrays to infinity except for the starting city, which will be 0 in `cost` and `discountCost`.
3. Add the starting city to the priority queue with cost 0.
4. While the priority queue is not empty:
   - Pop the city with the minimum cost from the priority queue.
   - For each flight from this city to a neighboring city:
     - Calculate the cost to reach the neighboring city without a discount (`newCost`) and with a discount (`newDiscountCost`).
     - If `newCost` or `newDiscountCost` is less than the current cost to reach the neighboring city, update the cost and discountCost arrays accordingly.
     - Add the neighboring city to the priority queue with the updated cost or discountCost.
5. Return the minimum cost to reach the destination city with or without a discount, whichever is smaller.
