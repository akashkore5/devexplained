### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each bomb and simulate the detonation process for each bomb. For each bomb, we calculate the number of bombs that will be detonated if that bomb is detonated. We keep track of the maximum number of bombs detonated by any single bomb and return that as the final answer.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `maxDetonated` to 0.
2. Iterate through each bomb in the input array.
3. For each bomb, calculate the number of bombs that will be detonated if that bomb is detonated.
4. Update `maxDetonated` if the number of detonated bombs for the current bomb is greater.
5. Return `maxDetonated` as the final answer.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the number of bombs since for each bomb, we potentially iterate through all other bombs. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDetonatedBombs(int[][] bombs) {
        int maxDetonated = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < bombs.length; i++) {
            int detonated = 1;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < bombs.length; j++) {
                if (j != i) {
                    int distance = (bombs[i][0] - bombs[j][0]) * (bombs[i][0] - bombs[j][0]) +
                                   (bombs[i][1] - bombs[j][1]) * (bombs[i][1] - bombs[j][1]);
                    int range = (bombs[i][2] + bombs[j][2]) * (bombs[i][2] + bombs[j][2]);
                    
                    if (distance <= range) {
                        detonated++;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            maxDetonated = Math.max(maxDetonated, detonated);
        }
        
        return maxDetonated;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDetonatedBombs(vector<vector<int>>& bombs) {
        int maxDetonated = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < bombs.size(); i++) {
            int detonated = 1;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < bombs.size(); j++) {
                if (j != i) {
                    int distance = pow(bombs[i][0] - bombs[j][0], 2) + pow(bombs[i][1] - bombs[j][1], 2);
                    int range = pow(bombs[i][2] + bombs[j][2], 2);
                    
                    if (distance <= range) {
                        detonated++;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            maxDetonated = max(maxDetonated, detonated);
        }
        
        return maxDetonated;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDetonatedBombs(self, bombs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        maxDetonated = 0
        
        for i in range(len(bombs)):
            detonated = 1
            
            for j in range(len(bombs)):
                if j != i:
                    distance = (bombs[i][0] - bombs[j][0]) ** 2 + (bombs[i][1] - bombs[j][1]) ** 2
                    range_val = (bombs[i][2] + bombs[j][2]) ** 2
                    
                    if distance <= range_val:
                        detonated += 1
            
            maxDetonated = max(maxDetonated, detonated)
        
        return maxDetonated
