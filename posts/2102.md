## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to store the locations based on their scores and names. We will also keep track of the number of queries made so far. When a new location is added, we insert it into the priority queue. When a query is made, we pop elements from the priority queue until we reach the ith best location.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a priority queue to store locations based on their scores and names.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of queries made.
3. Implement the `SORTracker` class with methods:
   - `SORTracker()`: Initializes the tracker system.
   - `add(String name, int score)`: Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system.
   - `get()`: Queries and returns the ith best location based on the number of times this method has been invoked.
4. When adding a location, create a custom `Location` class to store the name and score of each location.
5. When querying, pop elements from the priority queue until the ith best location is reached.

### Time Complexity:
- Adding a location: O(log n) where n is the number of locations added.
- Querying: O(i) where i is the number of times `get()` is called.

### Space Complexity:
- O(n) where n is the total number of locations added.
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class SORTracker {
    private class Location implements Comparable<Location> {
        String name;
        int score;

        public Location(String name, int score) {
            this.name = name;
            this.score = score;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(Location other) {
            if (this.score == other.score) {
                return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
            }
            return Integer.compare(other.score, this.score);
        }
    }

    private PriorityQueue<Location> locations;
    private int queries;

    public SORTracker() {
        locations = new PriorityQueue<>();
        queries = 0;
    }

    public void add(String name, int score) {
        locations.add(new Location(name, score));
    }

    public String get() {
        queries++;
        PriorityQueue<Location> copy = new PriorityQueue<>(locations);
        while (queries > 1) {
            copy.poll();
            queries--;
        }
        return copy.peek().name;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <queue>

#include <iostream>

class SORTracker {
private:
    struct Location {
        std::string name;
        int score;

        Location(std::string n, int s) : name(n), score(s) {}

        bool operator<(const Location& other) const {
            if (score == other.score) {
                return name > other.name;
            }
            return score < other.score;
        }
    };

    std::priority_queue<Location> locations;
    int queries;

public:
    SORTracker() : queries(0) {}

    void add(std::string name, int score) {
        locations.push(Location(name, score));
    }

    std::string get() {
        queries++;
        std::priority_queue<Location> copy(locations);
        while (queries > 1) {

            queries--;
        }
        return copy.top().name;
    }

```

```python

        self.queries = 0

    def add(self, name, score):

    def get(self):
        self.queries += 1
        copy = self.locations.copy()
        heapq.heapify(copy)
        while self.queries > 1:
            heapq.heappop(copy)
            self.queries -= 1
        return copy[0][1]
