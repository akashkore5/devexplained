### Explanation:
- We can simulate the watering process of Alice and Bob by iterating over the plants array from both ends.
- We keep track of the current water levels of Alice and Bob.
- If either Alice or Bob does not have enough water to water a plant, they refill their watering can and continue.
- We count the number of refills needed to water all the plants.

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int waterA = capacityA, waterB = capacityB;
