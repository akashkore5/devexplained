### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given array of stock prices and count the number of smooth descent periods. For each element in the array, we check if it is smaller than the previous element by exactly 1. If it is, then we have found a smooth descent period. We increment the count and continue checking for more smooth descent periods.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of smooth descent periods.
2. Iterate through the array of prices starting from index 1.
3. Check if the current price is exactly 1 less than the previous price.
4. If the condition is met, increment the `count`.
5. Continue iterating until the end of the array.
6. Return the final `count` as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countSmoothDescentPeriods(int[] prices) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSmoothDescentPeriods(vector<int>& prices) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countSmoothDescentPeriods(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1:
                count += 1
        
        return count
```
