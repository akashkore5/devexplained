### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum valid value that can be assigned to each element to maintain the K-increasing property. If the current element is less than or equal to the maximum valid value, we update the maximum valid value to the current element. Otherwise, we need to increment the count of operations needed and update the current element to the maximum valid value + 1.

At the end of the iteration, the total count of operations needed will be the answer.

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] arr, int k) {
        int operations = 0;
        int maxVal = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= maxVal) {
                maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, arr[i]);
            } else {
                operations += arr[i] - maxVal;
                maxVal = arr[i];
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int operations = 0;
        int maxVal = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= maxVal) {
                maxVal = max(maxVal, arr[i]);
            } else {
                operations += arr[i] - maxVal;
                maxVal = arr[i];
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        operations = 0
        maxVal = 0
        
        for num in arr:
            if num <= maxVal:
                maxVal = max(maxVal, num)
            else:
                operations += num - maxVal
                maxVal = num
        
        return operations
```
