## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a graph representation where each airport is a node and each flight is a directed edge from the departure airport to the arrival airport. We need to find the airport with the most traffic, which is defined as the airport with the most number of incoming and outgoing flights.

We can iterate through all the flights and maintain a count of incoming and outgoing flights for each airport. Finally, we can find the airport with the maximum traffic by comparing the total number of incoming and outgoing flights for each airport.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a graph where each airport is a node and each flight is a directed edge.
2. Iterate through all flights and update the incoming and outgoing flight count for each airport.
3. Find the airport with the most traffic by comparing the total incoming and outgoing flights for each airport.
4. Return the airport with the maximum traffic.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the total number of flights.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(N), where N is the total number of airports.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findAirportWithMostTraffic(int[][] flights) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> inFlights = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> outFlights = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int[] flight : flights) {
            outFlights.put(flight[0], outFlights.getOrDefault(flight[0], 0) + 1);
            inFlights.put(flight[1], inFlights.getOrDefault(flight[1], 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int maxTraffic = 0;
        int airport = -1;
        
        for (int airportNum : outFlights.keySet()) {
            int traffic = outFlights.getOrDefault(airportNum, 0) + inFlights.getOrDefault(airportNum, 0);
            if (traffic > maxTraffic) {
                maxTraffic = traffic;
                airport = airportNum;
            }
        }
        
        return airport;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findAirportWithMostTraffic(vector<vector<int>>& flights) {
        unordered_map<int, int> inFlights;
        unordered_map<int, int> outFlights;
        
        for (const auto& flight : flights) {
            outFlights[flight[0]]++;
            inFlights[flight[1]]++;
        }
        
        int maxTraffic = 0;
        int airport = -1;
        
        for (const auto& kvp : outFlights) {
            int traffic = kvp.second + inFlights[kvp.first];
            if (traffic > maxTraffic) {
                maxTraffic = traffic;
                airport = kvp.first;
            }
        }
        
        return airport;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def findAirportWithMostTraffic(self, flights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        in_flights = {}
        out_flights = {}
        
        for flight in flights:
            out_flights[flight[0]] = out_flights.get(flight[0], 0) + 1
            in_flights[flight[1]] = in_flights.get(flight[1], 0) + 1
        
        max_traffic = 0
        airport = -1
        
        for airport_num in out_flights.keys():
            traffic = out_flights.get(airport_num, 0) + in_flights.get(airport_num, 0)
            if traffic > max_traffic:
                max_traffic = traffic
                airport = airport_num
                
        return airport
