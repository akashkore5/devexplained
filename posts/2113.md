## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given array and maintain a set to keep track of all the elements that have been seen so far. For each element in the array, we check if it is present in the set. If it is present, we increment the element by 1 and check again. We repeat this process until we find an element that is not present in the set. Then, we add this element to the set and move on to the next element. The final array will contain the elements after all replacements have been made.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) as we are using a set to store the unique elements in the array.
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int[] replaceElements(int[] arr) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int num = arr[i];
            while (seen.contains(num)) {
                num++;
            }
            arr[i] = num;
            seen.add(num);
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> replaceElements(std::vector<int>& arr) {
        std::unordered_set<int> seen;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            int num = arr[i];
            while (seen.count(num)) {
                num++;
            }
            arr[i] = num;
            seen.insert(num);
        }
        return arr;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def replaceElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        seen = set()
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            num = arr[i]
            while num in seen:
                num += 1
            arr[i] = num
            seen.add(num)
        return arr
```
