### Explanation:
- We need to find the maximum number of words in a single sentence from the given array of sentences.
- We can achieve this by splitting each sentence into words using a space as a delimiter and counting the number of words in each sentence.
- Finally, we return the maximum number of words found in any sentence.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `maxWords` to store the maximum number of words found in a sentence.
2. Iterate through each sentence in the input array.
3. Split the current sentence into words using space as a delimiter.
4. Count the number of words in the current sentence.
5. Update `maxWords` if the number of words in the current sentence is greater than `maxWords`.
6. Return `maxWords` as the result.

**Time Complexity:**  
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*m), where n is the number of sentences and m is the average number of words in a sentence.

**Space Complexity:**  
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxWords(String[] sentences) {
        int maxWords = 0;
        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
            maxWords = Math.max(maxWords, words.length);
        }
        return maxWords;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxWords(std::vector<std::string>& sentences) {
        int maxWords = 0;
        for (const std::string& sentence : sentences) {
            std::vector<std::string> words;
            std::istringstream iss(sentence);
            std::string word;
            while (iss >> word) {
                words.push_back(word);
            }
            maxWords = std::max(maxWords, static_cast<int>(words.size()));
        }
        return maxWords;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxWords(self, sentences: List[str]) -> int:
        maxWords = 0
        for sentence in sentences:
            words = sentence.split()
            maxWords = max(maxWords, len(words))
        return maxWords
