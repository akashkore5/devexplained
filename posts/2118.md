## Explanation:

This problem asks us to build a mathematical equation based on a given target value and a set of numbers. The equation should be constructed using addition, subtraction, and multiplication operators. We need to return all possible equations that can be formed to achieve the target value.

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking to explore all possible combinations of operators and operands. At each step, we can choose either addition, subtraction, or multiplication to build the equation. We recursively explore all possibilities and backtrack when needed.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Start by defining a backtracking function that takes the current value, target value, index of the next number to be considered, the current equation string, and the result list.
2. In the backtracking function, check if we have reached the end of the numbers array and if the current value matches the target value. If so, add the current equation to the result list.
3. Otherwise, for the current number, try adding, subtracting, or multiplying it with the current value and continue exploring the possibilities recursively.
4. Remember to backtrack by removing the last operation from the equation string before proceeding to the next step.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this backtracking solution is exponential, as we are exploring all possible combinations.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also exponential due to the recursive nature of the backtracking algorithm.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> buildEquation(int[] nums, int target) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(nums, target, 0, 0, "", result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int[] nums, int target, int index, int current, String equation, List<String> result) {
        if (index == nums.length) {
            if (current == target) {
                result.add(equation);
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = index; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i != index && nums[index] == 0) continue; // Skip leading zeros
            int num = nums[i];
            
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current + num, equation + "+" + num, result);
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current - num, equation + "-" + num, result);
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current * num, equation + "*" + num, result);
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> buildEquation(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<string> result;
        backtrack(nums, target, 0, 0, "", result);
        return result;
    }
    
    void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int target, int index, int current, string equation, vector<string>& result) {
        if (index == nums.size()) {
            if (current == target) {
                result.push_back(equation);
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = index; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i != index && nums[index] == 0) continue; // Skip leading zeros
            int num = nums[i];
            
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current + num, equation + "+" + to_string(num), result);
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current - num, equation + "-" + to_string(num), result);
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current * num, equation + "*" + to_string(num), result);
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def buildEquation(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        
        def backtrack(index, current, equation):
            if index == len(nums):
                if current == target:
                    result.append(equation)
                return
            
            for i in range(index, len(nums)):
                if i != index and nums[index] == 0:
                    continue  # Skip leading zeros
                num = nums[i]
                
                backtrack(i + 1, current + num, equation + "+" + str(num))
                backtrack(i + 1, current - num, equation + "-" + str(num))
                backtrack(i + 1, current * num, equation + "*" + str(num))
        
        backtrack(0, 0, "")
        return result
