## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the movement of the robot based on the given instructions and check how many instructions it can execute starting from each position. We will keep track of the number of instructions executed until the robot moves off the grid or all instructions are executed.

We can iterate through each starting point and for each starting point, we iterate through the instructions in the given order. At each step, we update the position of the robot based on the instruction and check if the new position is within the grid. If it is within the grid, we increment the count of executed instructions. If the new position is outside the grid, we stop and record the count of instructions executed so far.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * m) where n is the size of the grid and m is the length of the instruction string.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] executionOfAllSuffixInstructions(int n, int[] startPos, String s) {
        int m = s.length();
        int[] answer = new int[m];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int row = startPos[0];
            int col = startPos[1];
            int count = 0;
            
            for (int j = i; j < m; j++) {
                char instruction = s.charAt(j);
                
                if (instruction == 'L' && col > 0) {
                    col--;
                    count++;
                } else if (instruction == 'R' && col < n - 1) {
                    col++;
                    count++;
                } else if (instruction == 'U' && row > 0) {
                    row--;
                    count++;
                } else if (instruction == 'D' && row < n - 1) {
                    row++;
                    count++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            answer[i] = count;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
