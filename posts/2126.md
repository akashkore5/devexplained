### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of colliding asteroids with the planet. We can use a priority queue to maintain the order of asteroids based on their mass. We start by adding all the asteroids to the priority queue. Then, we iterate through the priority queue and simulate the collisions with the planet. If at any point the planet's mass is less than an asteroid's mass, we return false. If we successfully process all asteroids, we return true.

#### Algorithm:
1. Create a priority queue to store asteroids based on their mass.
2. Add all asteroids to the priority queue.
3. Initialize the planet's mass to the given initial mass.
4. Iterate through the priority queue:
   - If the planet's mass is greater than or equal to the current asteroid's mass, destroy the asteroid and update the planet's mass.
   - If the planet's mass is less than the current asteroid's mass, return false.
5. If all asteroids are successfully destroyed, return true.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of asteroids.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) to store the priority queue.

:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public boolean canDestroyAsteroids(int mass, int[] asteroids) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        for (int asteroid : asteroids) {
            pq.offer(asteroid);
        }
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int currentAsteroid = pq.poll();
            if (mass >= currentAsteroid) {
                mass += currentAsteroid;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canDestroyAsteroids(int mass, std::vector<int>& asteroids) {
        std::priority_queue<int> pq(asteroids.begin(), asteroids.end());
        
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            int currentAsteroid = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            if (mass >= currentAsteroid) {
                mass += currentAsteroid;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def canDestroyAsteroids(self, mass: int, asteroids: List[int]) -> bool:
        asteroids.sort(reverse=True)
        
        while asteroids:
            current_asteroid = asteroids.pop(0)
            
            if mass >= current_asteroid:
                mass += current_asteroid
            else:
                return False
        
        return True
