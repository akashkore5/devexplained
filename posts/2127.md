### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting while satisfying the condition that each employee can only attend if they can sit next to their favorite person. We can approach this problem by iterating through each employee and checking if we can form a cycle of employees and their favorite persons. We can use a visited array to keep track of visited employees to avoid double counting. By forming cycles, we can find the maximum number of employees that can be invited.

1. Create a visited array to mark visited employees.
2. Iterate through each employee.
3. For each unvisited employee, start forming a cycle by following their favorite person until we reach a previously visited employee or form a cycle.
4. Count the number of employees in the cycle.
5. Repeat the process for all employees and update the maximum number of employees in a cycle.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of employees.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the visited array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxEmployees(int[] favorite) {
        int n = favorite.length;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int maxEmployees = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int current = i;
                int count = 0;
                do {
                    visited[current] = true;
                    current = favorite[current];
                    count++;
                } while (current != i);
                
                maxEmployees = Math.max(maxEmployees, count);
            }
        }
        
        return maxEmployees;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxEmployees(std::vector<int>& favorite) {
        int n = favorite.size();
        std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        int maxEmployees = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int current = i;
                int count = 0;
                do {
                    visited[current] = true;
                    current = favorite[current];
                    count++;
                } while (current != i);
                
                maxEmployees = std::max(maxEmployees, count);
            }
        }
        
        return maxEmployees;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxEmployees(self, favorite: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(favorite)
        visited = [False] * n
        maxEmployees = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                current = i
                count = 0
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = favorite[current]
                    count += 1
                
                maxEmployees = max(maxEmployees, count)
        
        return maxEmployees
