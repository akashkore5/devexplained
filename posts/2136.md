### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of planting and growing the seeds day by day until all seeds have bloomed. We can keep track of the days each seed is planted and the days it takes to grow. We will iterate through the days, planting and growing the seeds accordingly, until all seeds have bloomed.

1. We will create a priority queue to keep track of the seeds that are ready to grow on each day.
2. We will create a variable to store the current day.
3. We will iterate through the days until all seeds have bloomed, checking and updating the status of each seed on each day.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - where n is the number of seeds  
Space Complexity: O(n)

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int earliestDayToFullBloom(int[] plantTime, int[] growTime) {
        int n = plantTime.length;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int day = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pq.offer(new int[]{plantTime[i], growTime[i]});
        }

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] seed = pq.poll();
            day = Math.max(day + seed[0], seed[1]);
        }

        return day;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int earliestDayToFullBloom(std::vector<int>& plantTime, std::vector<int>& growTime) {
        int n = plantTime.size();
        std::priority_queue<std::vector<int>, std::vector<std::vector<int>>, std::greater<>> pq;
        int day = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pq.push({plantTime[i], growTime[i]});
        }

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto seed = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            day = std::max(day + seed[0], seed[1]);
        }

        return day;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def earliestDayToFullBloom(self, plantTime: List[int], growTime: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(plantTime)
        pq = []
        day = 0

        for i in range(n):
            heapq.heappush(pq, [plantTime[i], growTime[i]])

        while pq:
            seed = heapq.heappop(pq)
            day = max(day + seed[0], seed[1])

        return day
```
