## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we simulate the pouring process step by step. We iterate through each bucket and simulate pouring water either to the left or right based on the given rules. We repeat this process `V` times, where `V` is the volume of water to be poured.

### Algorithm:
1. Iterate `V` times to simulate pouring water.
2. For each iteration, iterate through each bucket and simulate pouring water either left or right based on the rules.
3. After pouring water, check if the water levels are equal to the target level.
4. Repeat the process for all iterations.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(V*N), where N is the number of buckets and V is the volume of water to be poured.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of buckets.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] pourWater(int[] heights, int V, int K) {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            pour(heights, K);
        }
        return heights;
    }

    private void pour(int[] heights, int K) {
        int left = K;
        while (left > 0 && heights[left] >= heights[left - 1]) {
            left--;
        }
        while (left < K && heights[left] == heights[left + 1]) {
            left++;
        }
        
        if (left != K) {
            heights[left]++;
            return;
        }
        
        int right = K;
        while (right < heights.length - 1 && heights[right] >= heights[right + 1]) {
            right++;
        }
        while (right > K && heights[right] == heights[right - 1]) {
            right--;
        }
        
        heights[right]++;
    }
}
```

```cpp

    vector<int> pourWater(vector<int>& heights, int V, int K) {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {

        }
        return heights;
    }
    
    void pour(vector<int>& heights, int K) {
        int left = K;

            left--;
        }
        while (left < K && heights[left] == heights[left + 1]) {
            left++;
        }
        
        if (left != K) {
            heights[left]++;

        }
        while (right > K && heights[right] == heights[right - 1]) {
            right--;
        }
        
        heights[right]++;
    }
};
