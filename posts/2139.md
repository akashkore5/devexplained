## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array `dp` to store the minimum number of moves needed to reach each integer from 1 to the target. At each step, we will consider two options: incrementing by 1 or doubling the current integer. We will update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum of the following two cases:
1. Incrementing from `i-1` and increasing the moves count by 1.
2. Doubling from `i/2` if `i` is even and less than or equal to `maxDoubles` and increasing the moves count by 1.

We will iterate through the array from 1 to the target and update the `dp` array accordingly. Finally, we return `dp[target]`, which will give us the minimum number of moves needed to reach the target.

- Time complexity: O(target)
- Space complexity: O(target)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int target, int maxDoubles) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= target; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
            if (i % 2 == 0 && i / 2 <= maxDoubles) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i / 2] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMoves(int target, int maxDoubles) {
        vector<int> dp(target + 1);
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= target; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
            if (i % 2 == 0 && i / 2 <= maxDoubles) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i / 2] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, target: int, maxDoubles: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        
        for i in range(2, target + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
            if i % 2 == 0 and i // 2 <= maxDoubles:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // 2] + 1)
        
        return dp[target]
```
