## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points we can earn at each question. We iterate through the questions array and for each question, we consider two possibilities: solve the question or skip the question. If we solve the question, we update the maximum points we can earn based on the points earned from the current question and the maximum points earned from the previous questions that are still solvable. If we skip the question, we simply update the maximum points earned without considering the current question.

At the end of the iteration, the maximum points we can earn will be the maximum value in our dynamic programming array.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of questions.
Space complexity: O(n), for the dynamic programming array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[][] questions) {
        int n = questions.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = questions[0][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int solve = i - questions[i][1] - 1 >= 0 ? dp[i - questions[i][1] - 1] + questions[i][0] : questions[i][0];
            int skip = dp[i - 1];
            dp[i] = Math.max(solve, skip);
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPoints(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& questions) {
        int n = questions.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n, 0);
        dp[0] = questions[0][0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int solve = i - questions[i][1] - 1 >= 0 ? dp[i - questions[i][1] - 1] + questions[i][0] : questions[i][0];
            int skip = dp[i - 1];
            dp[i] = std::max(solve, skip);
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(questions)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = questions[0][0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            solve = dp[i - questions[i][1] - 1] + questions[i][0] if i - questions[i][1] - 1 >= 0 else questions[i][0]
            skip = dp[i - 1]
            dp[i] = max(solve, skip)

        return dp[n - 1]
```
