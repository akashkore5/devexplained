### Explanation:
To maximize the running time of all n computers simultaneously, we need to carefully manage the batteries. We can achieve this by inserting batteries with the longest remaining runtime into the computers and swapping batteries when needed. The key idea is to always have the maximum possible total running time across all computers.

1. Sort the batteries in descending order.
2. Initialize a priority queue (max heap) to store the remaining battery times.
3. Iterate through the batteries, inserting them into computers and updating the total running time.
4. If a battery is drained, remove it from the queue and insert a new battery with the longest remaining time.
5. Continue this process until all computers stop running.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of batteries.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the priority queue.

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int maxRunningTime(int n, int[] batteries) {
        Arrays.sort(batteries);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        int totalTime = 0;
        
        for (int battery : batteries) {
            pq.offer(battery);
            totalTime += battery;
            if (pq.size() > n) {
                totalTime -= pq.poll();
            }
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxRunningTime(int n, std::vector<int>& batteries) {
        std::sort(batteries.begin(), batteries.end(), std::greater<int>());
        std::priority_queue<int> pq;
        int totalTime = 0;
        
        for (int battery : batteries) {
            pq.push(battery);
            totalTime += battery;
            if (pq.size() > n) {
                totalTime -= pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxRunningTime(self, n: int, batteries: List[int]) -> int:
        batteries.sort(reverse=True)
        pq = []
        totalTime = 0
        
        for battery in batteries:
            heapq.heappush(pq, -battery)
            totalTime += battery
            if len(pq) > n:
                totalTime -= -heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        return totalTime
```
