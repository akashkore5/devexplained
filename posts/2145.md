### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find all possible hidden sequences that satisfy the given differences and lie within the inclusive range [lower, upper]. We can approach this problem using dynamic programming.

1. Initialize a dynamic programming array dp of size n+1 to store the count of possible hidden sequences ending at index i.
2. Initialize dp[0] = 1, as there is only one way to form a hidden sequence of length 1.
3. Iterate through the differences array and update dp[i+1] based on the valid sequences that can be formed from dp[i] for each difference.
4. Finally, count the total number of valid hidden sequences within the range [lower, upper] from dp.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the differences array.
**Space Complexity:** O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public int countHiddenSequences(int[] differences, int lower, int upper) {
        int n = differences.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (dp[j] > 0 && lower <= dp[j] + differences[i] && dp[j] + differences[i] <= upper) {
                    dp[i + 1] += dp[j];
                }
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int num : dp) {
            if (num > 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countHiddenSequences(vector<int>& differences, int lower, int upper) {
        int n = differences.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (dp[j] > 0 && lower <= dp[j] + differences[i] && dp[j] + differences[i] <= upper) {
                    dp[i + 1] += dp[j];
                }
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int num : dp) {
            if (num > 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countHiddenSequences(self, differences: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:
        n = len(differences)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1):
                if dp[j] > 0 and lower <= dp[j] + differences[i] <= upper:
                    dp[i + 1] += dp[j]

        count = sum(1 for num in dp if num > 0)
        return count
