### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the corridor and count the number of ways to divide the corridor at each position. We can keep track of the number of seats and plants encountered so far. If the current position is a seat, we can calculate the number of ways based on the number of seats and plants encountered so far.

At each position, we can have the following scenarios:
1. Two seats encountered: We can place a divider to create a section with two seats and any number of plants in between.
2. One seat and one plant encountered: We can place a divider to create a section with two seats and the plant in between.
3. Two plants encountered: We cannot place a divider as there must be exactly two seats in each section.

We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways at each position and calculate the final result modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the corridor.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int waysToDivide(String corridor) {
        long MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = corridor.length();
        long ways = 0;
        int seats = 0, plants = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (corridor.charAt(i) == 'S') {
                seats++;
            } else {
                plants++;
            }

            if (seats >= 2 && plants >= 1) {
                ways = (ways + Math.min(seats - 1, plants)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) ways;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int waysToDivide(string corridor) {
        long MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = corridor.length();
        long ways = 0;
        int seats = 0, plants = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (corridor[i] == 'S') {
                seats++;
            } else {
                plants++;
            }

            if (seats >= 2 && plants >= 1) {
                ways = (ways + min(seats - 1, plants)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) ways;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def waysToDivide(self, corridor: str) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        n = len(corridor)
        ways = 0
        seats = 0
        plants = 0

        for char in corridor:
            if char == 'S':
                seats += 1
            else:
                plants += 1

            if seats >= 2 and plants >= 1:
                ways = (ways + min(seats - 1, plants)) % MOD

        return ways
