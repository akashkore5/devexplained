## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum number of lines needed to cover a set of points. The idea is to find the maximum difference between consecutive points in either the x-axis or y-axis and sum them up to get the total number of lines needed.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `lines` to 0.
2. Iterate over the points starting from the second point.
3. For each point, calculate the absolute differences in x and y coordinates with the previous point.
4. Increment `lines` by the maximum of the two differences.
5. Return `lines` as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points) {
        int lines = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            int dx = Math.abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
            int dy = Math.abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1]);
            lines += Math.max(dx, dy);
        }
        return lines;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int lines = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int dx = abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
            int dy = abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1]);
            lines += max(dx, dy);
        }
        return lines;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        lines = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            dx = abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0])
            dy = abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1])
            lines += max(dx, dy)
        return lines
```
