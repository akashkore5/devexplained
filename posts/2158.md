## Explanation:

The problem asks us to calculate the amount of new area painted each day given a list of painted cells. The new area painted each day is defined as the cells that were not painted the previous day but are painted today.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of painted cells and maintain a set to keep track of the cells that have been painted. We can then iterate through the list of painted cells each day and compare it with the set of painted cells from the previous day to calculate the new area painted each day.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty set `painted_cells` to store the painted cells.
2. Initialize a variable `new_area` to store the amount of new area painted each day.
3. Iterate through the list of painted cells:
   - For each day, calculate the new area painted by subtracting the previous day's painted cells from the current day's painted cells.
   - Add the new area painted each day to the `new_area`.
   - Update the set `painted_cells` with the current day's painted cells for the next iteration.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of painted cells.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the painted cells in the set.

:

```java
public int[] amountOfNewAreaPaintedEachDay(int[][] painted) {
    Set<String> paintedCells = new HashSet<>();
    int[] newAreaPaintedEachDay = new int[painted.length - 1];
    
    for (int i = 1; i < painted.length; i++) {
        Set<String> currentDayPainted = new HashSet<>();
        for (int j = 0; j < painted[i].length; j++) {
            currentDayPainted.add(painted[i][j] + "-" + painted[i][j + 1]);
        }
        Set<String> newAreaPainted = new HashSet<>(currentDayPainted);
        newAreaPainted.removeAll(paintedCells);
        paintedCells.addAll(currentDayPainted);
        
        newAreaPaintedEachDay[i - 1] = newAreaPainted.size();
    }
    
    return newAreaPaintedEachDay;
}
```

```cpp
vector<int> amountOfNewAreaPaintedEachDay(vector<vector<int>>& painted) {
    unordered_set<string> paintedCells;
    vector<int> newAreaPaintedEachDay(painted.size() - 1, 0);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < painted.size(); i++) {
        unordered_set<string> currentDayPainted;
        for (int j = 0; j < painted[i].size(); j += 2) {
            currentDayPainted.insert(to_string(painted[i][j]) + "-" + to_string(painted[i][j + 1]));
        }
        unordered_set<string> newAreaPainted;
        for (const string& cell : currentDayPainted) {
            if (paintedCells.find(cell) == paintedCells.end()) {
                newAreaPainted.insert(cell);
            }
        }
        for (const string& cell : currentDayPainted) {
            paintedCells.insert(cell);
        }
        
        newAreaPaintedEachDay[i - 1] = newAreaPainted.size();
    }
    
    return newAreaPaintedEachDay;
}
```

```python
def amount_of_new_area_painted_each_day(painted):
    painted_cells = set()
    new_area_painted_each_day = [0] * (len(painted) - 1)
    
    for i in range(1, len(painted)):
        current_day_painted = set()
        for j in range(0, len(painted[i]), 2):
            current_day_painted.add(str(painted[i][j]) + "-" + str(painted[i][j + 1]))
        new_area_painted = current_day_painted.difference(painted_cells)
        painted_cells.update(current_day_painted)
        
        new_area_painted_each_day[i - 1] = len(new_area_painted)
    
    return new_area_painted_each_day
