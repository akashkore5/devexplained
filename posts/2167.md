### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string `s` and count the number of cars containing illegal goods from both ends. We can then compare the counts from left to right and right to left to find the minimum time required to remove all cars containing illegal goods. 

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to keep track of the count of cars containing illegal goods from the left and right ends respectively.
2. Iterate through the string from left to right and increment `left` whenever we encounter a car containing illegal goods.
3. Iterate through the string from right to left and increment `right` whenever we encounter a car containing illegal goods.
4. Compare `left` and `right` to find the minimum time required to remove all cars containing illegal goods.
5. Return the minimum time obtained.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`.
- Space complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToType(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        int minTime = Math.min(left, n - left);
        
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                right++;
            }
            minTime = Math.min(minTime, right + n - 1 - i);
        }
        
        return minTime;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToType(string s) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int n = s.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        int minTime = min(left, n - left);
        
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                right++;
            }
            minTime = min(minTime, right + n - 1 - i);
        }
        
        return minTime;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, s: str) -> int:
        left, right = 0, 0
        n = len(s)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '1':
                left += 1
        
        min_time = min(left, n - left)
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == '1':
                right += 1
            min_time = min(min_time, right + n - 1 - i)
        
        return min_time
