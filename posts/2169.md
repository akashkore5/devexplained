## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the operations described in the problem statement until one of the numbers becomes zero. In each operation, we choose the larger number and subtract the smaller number from it. We repeat this process until one of the numbers becomes zero.

Here's an outline of the algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of operations.
2. While both num1 and num2 are greater than zero:
   - If num1 is greater than or equal to num2, subtract num2 from num1.
   - Otherwise, subtract num1 from num2.
   - Increment the counter for each operation.
3. Return the counter as the result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(max(num1, num2))) as it takes logarithmic time to reduce the numbers to zero using the described operations. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOperationsToObtainZero(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        while (num1 > 0 && num2 > 0) {
            if (num1 >= num2) {
                num1 -= num2;
            } else {
                num2 -= num1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countOperationsToObtainZero(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        while (num1 > 0 && num2 > 0) {
            if (num1 >= num2) {
                num1 -= num2;
            } else {
                num2 -= num1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countOperationsToObtainZero(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        operations = 0
        
        while num1 > 0 and num2 > 0:
            if num1 >= num2:
                num1 -= num2
            else:
                num2 -= num1
            operations += 1
        
        return operations
```
