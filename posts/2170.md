## Explanation
To make the array alternating, we need to ensure that every two consecutive elements are different. We can achieve this by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is the same as the previous two elements. If it is the same, we need to change it to a different number. We can achieve this by keeping track of the number of operations needed to change the element at each index.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `ops` to store the total number of operations needed.
2. Iterate through the array starting from index 2.
3. For each element at index `i`, if it is the same as the previous two elements, increment `ops` by 1 and update the current element to a different number.
4. Return the total number of operations `ops`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 2]) {
                ops++;
                nums[i] = nums[i] == nums[i - 1] ? nums[i] + 1 : nums[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ops = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 2]) {
                ops++;
                nums[i] = nums[i] == nums[i - 1] ? nums[i] + 1 : nums[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return ops;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ops = 0
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 2]:
                ops += 1
                nums[i] = nums[i] if nums[i] != nums[i - 1] else nums[i] + 1
        return ops
```
