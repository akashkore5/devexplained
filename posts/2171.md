### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of magic beans to remove in order to make the number of beans in each non-empty bag equal. We can achieve this by finding the average number of beans in all bags and then calculating the excess or deficit beans in each bag with respect to this average.

We can iterate through the bags to calculate the total number of beans and the number of bags with excess or deficit beans. We then remove beans from bags with excess beans and distribute them among bags with deficit beans until all bags have an equal number of beans.

- Calculate the total number of beans and the average number of beans per bag.
- Iterate through the bags to determine the excess or deficit beans in each bag.
- Remove beans from bags with excess beans and distribute them to bags with deficit beans.
- Repeat the process until all bags have an equal number of beans.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] beans) {
        int totalBeans = 0;
        int n = beans.length;
        for (int bean : beans) {
            totalBeans += bean;
        }
        
        int avgBeans = totalBeans / n;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int bean : beans) {
            if (bean > avgBeans) {
                count += bean - avgBeans;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& beans) {
        int totalBeans = 0;
        int n = beans.size();
        for (int bean : beans) {
            totalBeans += bean;
        }
        
        int avgBeans = totalBeans / n;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int bean : beans) {
            if (bean > avgBeans) {
                count += bean - avgBeans;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, beans: List[int]) -> int:
        totalBeans = sum(beans)
        n = len(beans)
        avgBeans = totalBeans // n
        count = 0
        
        for bean in beans:
            if bean > avgBeans:
                count += bean - avgBeans
        
        return count
```
