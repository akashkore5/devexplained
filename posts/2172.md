### Explanation:
To maximize the AND sum, we need to strategically place the numbers into slots such that the bitwise AND operation between each number and its corresponding slot number contributes to the sum. We can achieve this by considering the binary representation of the numbers and the slot numbers.

1. Iterate over all possible bit positions from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.
2. For each bit position, count the number of set bits in the numbers that have a set bit at that position.
3. Place the numbers with the most significant bits in the slots that correspond to the positions of the set bits.
4. Repeat this process for each subsequent bit position until all numbers are placed in the slots.

By following this approach, we can maximize the AND sum of the array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMaxAndSum(int[] nums, int numSlots) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int total = 0;
        
        for (int bit = 14; bit >= 0; bit--) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (((num >> bit) & 1) == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            if (count <= numSlots) {
                total += (1 << bit) * count;
                numSlots -= count;
            } else {
                total += (1 << bit) * numSlots;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaxAndSum(vector<int>& nums, int numSlots) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int total = 0;
        
        for (int bit = 14; bit >= 0; bit--) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (((num >> bit) & 1) == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            if (count <= numSlots) {
                total += (1 << bit) * count;
                numSlots -= count;
            } else {
                total += (1 << bit) * numSlots;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxAndSum(self, nums: List[int], numSlots: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        
        for bit in range(14, -1, -1):
            count = sum((num >> bit) & 1 for num in nums)
            
            if count <= numSlots:
                total += (1 << bit) * count
                numSlots -= count
            else:
                total += (1 << bit) * numSlots
                break
                
        return total
