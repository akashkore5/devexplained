## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate through the array of game results and keep track of the longest winning streak ending at each position. We will maintain two arrays - one to store the longest winning streak ending at each position when the current game is a win, and another to store the longest winning streak ending at each position when the current game is a loss. We will update these arrays based on the current game result.

At each position, the longest winning streak ending at that position is determined by considering the longest winning streak ending at the previous position and updating it accordingly.

After processing all the games, the maximum value in the winning streak array will be the length of the longest winning streak.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of games
- Space complexity: O(n) for storing the arrays
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestWinningStreak(int[] games) {
        int n = games.length;
        int[] winStreak = new int[n];
        int[] lossStreak = new int[n];

        winStreak[0] = games[0] == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        lossStreak[0] = games[0] == 0 ? 1 : 0;

        int maxStreak = Math.max(winStreak[0], lossStreak[0]);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (games[i] == 1) {
                winStreak[i] = winStreak[i - 1] + 1;
                lossStreak[i] = 0;
            } else {
                lossStreak[i] = lossStreak[i - 1] + 1;
                winStreak[i] = 0;
            }
            maxStreak = Math.max(maxStreak, Math.max(winStreak[i], lossStreak[i]));
        }

        return maxStreak;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestWinningStreak(vector<int>& games) {
        int n = games.size();
        vector<int> winStreak(n);
        vector<int> lossStreak(n);

        winStreak[0] = games[0] == 1 ? 1 : 0;
        lossStreak[0] = games[0] == 0 ? 1 : 0;

        int maxStreak = max(winStreak[0], lossStreak[0]);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (games[i] == 1) {
                winStreak[i] = winStreak[i - 1] + 1;
                lossStreak[i] = 0;
            } else {
                lossStreak[i] = lossStreak[i - 1] + 1;
                winStreak[i] = 0;
            }
            maxStreak = max(maxStreak, max(winStreak[i], lossStreak[i]));
        }

        return maxStreak;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def longestWinningStreak(self, games: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(games)
        winStreak = [0] * n
        lossStreak = [0] * n

        winStreak[0] = 1 if games[0] == 1 else 0
        lossStreak[0] = 1 if games[0] == 0 else 0

        maxStreak = max(winStreak[0], lossStreak[0])

        for i in range(1, n):
            if games[i] == 1:
                winStreak[i] = winStreak[i - 1] + 1
                lossStreak[i] = 0
            else:
                lossStreak[i] = lossStreak[i - 1] + 1
                winStreak[i] = 0
            maxStreak = max(maxStreak, max(winStreak[i], lossStreak[i]))

        return maxStreak
