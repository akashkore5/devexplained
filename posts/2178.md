### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start by iterating from 2 to finalSum (inclusive) and greedily select the largest even number possible until the remaining sum becomes less than the next even number. This way, we can maximize the number of unique positive even integers in the split. We need to keep track of the remaining sum and the selected even integers. If the remaining sum reaches 0, we have found a valid split.

- **Algorithmic Idea**:
  1. Start iterating from 2 to finalSum.
  2. At each step, check if the current even number can be included in the split without exceeding the remaining sum.
  3. If yes, update the remaining sum and include the current even number in the split.
  4. Continue this process until the remaining sum becomes 0 or no valid split is possible.
  5. Return the list of selected even integers if a valid split is found.

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the value of finalSum.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> splitIntoMaximumEvenNumbers(int finalSum) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int remainingSum = finalSum;
        
        for (int num = 2; num <= finalSum; num += 2) {
            if (remainingSum >= num) {
                result.add(num);
                remainingSum -= num;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (remainingSum == 0) {
            return result;
        } else {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> splitIntoMaximumEvenNumbers(int finalSum) {
        vector<int> result;
        int remainingSum = finalSum;
        
        for (int num = 2; num <= finalSum; num += 2) {
            if (remainingSum >= num) {
                result.push_back(num);
                remainingSum -= num;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (remainingSum == 0) {
            return result;
        } else {
            return {};
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def splitIntoMaximumEvenNumbers(self, finalSum: int) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        remainingSum = finalSum
        
        for num in range(2, finalSum+1, 2):
            if remainingSum >= num:
                result.append(num)
                remainingSum -= num
            else:
                break
        
        if remainingSum == 0:
            return result
        else:
            return []
