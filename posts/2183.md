## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) in the given array `nums`. For each pair, we calculate the product of the elements at those indices and check if the product is divisible by `k`. If it is divisible, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs.

The key idea is to use a hash map to store the frequency of remainders when dividing the elements of the array by `k`. We iterate through the array and calculate the remainder of each element when divided by `k`, then store the frequency of each remainder in the hash map. After that, we iterate through the hash map and calculate the total count of pairs that are divisible by `k`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(k), where k is the value of the integer `k`.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> remainders = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int remainder = num % k;
            int complement = (k - remainder) % k;
            count += remainders.getOrDefault(complement, 0);
            remainders.put(remainder, remainders.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> remainders;
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int remainder = num % k;
            int complement = (k - remainder) % k;
            count += remainders[complement];
            remainders[remainder]++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        remainders = defaultdict(int)
        count = 0

        for num in nums:
            remainder = num % k
            complement = (k - remainder) % k
            count += remainders[complement]
            remainders[remainder] += 1

        return count
```
