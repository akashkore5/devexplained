### Explanation:

In this problem, we are given a wall made up of bricks of varying heights. We need to find the number of ways to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom that crosses the fewest number of bricks. If a vertical line crosses the edge between two bricks, we consider this as crossing both bricks.

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the position where the sum of brick heights changes. By counting the frequency of these positions, we can determine the number of bricks that share the same edge. The key insight is to find the position that has the maximum frequency. The number of ways to draw a vertical line with the fewest number of crossings is the total number of bricks minus the maximum frequency.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int leastBricks(List<List<Integer>> wall) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> edgeCounts = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (List<Integer> row : wall) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < row.size() - 1; i++) {
                sum += row.get(i);
                edgeCounts.put(sum, edgeCounts.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        int maxEdges = 0;
        for (int count : edgeCounts.values()) {
            maxEdges = Math.max(maxEdges, count);
        }
        
        return wall.size() - maxEdges;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastBricks(vector<vector<int>>& wall) {
        unordered_map<int, int> edgeCounts;
        
        for (auto row : wall) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < row.size() - 1; i++) {
                sum += row[i];
                edgeCounts[sum]++;
            }
        }
        
        int maxEdges = 0;
        for (auto& count : edgeCounts) {
            maxEdges = max(maxEdges, count.second);
        }
        
        return wall.size() - maxEdges;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def leastBricks(self, wall: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        edge_counts = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        for row in wall:
            total = 0
            for i in range(len(row) - 1):
                total += row[i]
                edge_counts[total] += 1
        
        max_edges = 0
        for count in edge_counts.values():
            max_edges = max(max_edges, count)
        
        return len(wall) - max_edges
```
