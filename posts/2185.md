### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each word in the `words` array and check if the current word starts with the given prefix `pref`. We can do this by comparing the substring of the word from index 0 to the length of the prefix with the prefix itself. If they match, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of words that contain the given prefix. The time complexity of this approach is O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the length of the prefix. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countWordsWithPrefix(String[] words, String pref) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (word.startsWith(pref)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countWordsWithPrefix(vector<string>& words, string pref) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            if (word.substr(0, pref.length()) == pref) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countWordsWithPrefix(self, words: List[str], pref: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for word in words:
            if word.startswith(pref):
                count += 1
        return count
```
