### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of anagram by counting the frequency of characters in both strings `s` and `t`. We can then find the difference between the frequencies of characters. The minimum number of steps required to make `s` and `t` anagrams of each other would be the sum of absolute differences of frequencies of characters in both strings.

1. Create an array to store the frequency of characters for both strings `s` and `t`.
2. Iterate through both strings and update the frequency array accordingly.
3. Calculate the absolute difference in frequencies for each character.
4. Sum up all the absolute differences to get the minimum number of steps required.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int[] frequency = new int[26];
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            frequency[c - 'a']--;
        }
        
        int steps = 0;
        for (int count : frequency) {
            steps += Math.abs(count);
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> frequency(26, 0);
        
        for (char c : s) {
            frequency[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : t) {
            frequency[c - 'a']--;
        }
        
        int steps = 0;
        for (int count : frequency) {
            steps += abs(count);
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        frequency = [0] * 26
        
        for c in s:
            frequency[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        for c in t:
            frequency[ord(c) - ord('a')] -= 1
        
        steps = sum(abs(count) for count in frequency)
        
        return steps
```
