### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips. We can approach this problem using binary search. We define a function `numTripsCompleted` that calculates the total number of trips completed by all buses at a given time `t`. Then, we perform binary search on the time range to find the minimum time that satisfies the condition of completing at least `totalTrips` trips.

1. **Algorithm**:
   - Define a function `numTripsCompleted` that calculates the total number of trips completed by all buses at a given time `t`.
   - Perform binary search on the time range [1, 10^9] to find the minimum time that satisfies completing at least `totalTrips` trips.

2. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is O(log(10^9) * n), where n is the number of buses.

3. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToCompleteTrips(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        int left = 1, right = (int)1e9;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (numTripsCompleted(time, mid) < totalTrips) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private int numTripsCompleted(int[] time, int t) {
        int totalTrips = 0;
        for (int tripTime : time) {
            totalTrips += t / tripTime;
        }
        return totalTrips;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToCompleteTrips(vector<int>& time, int totalTrips) {
        int left = 1, right = 1e9;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (numTripsCompleted(time, mid) < totalTrips) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    int numTripsCompleted(vector<int>& time, int t) {
        int totalTrips = 0;
        for (int tripTime : time) {
            totalTrips += t / tripTime;
        }
        return totalTrips;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToCompleteTrips(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, 10**9
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if self.numTripsCompleted(time, mid) < totalTrips:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        return left
    
    def numTripsCompleted(self, time: List[int], t: int) -> int:
        totalTrips = 0
        for tripTime in time:
            totalTrips += t // tripTime
        return totalTrips
