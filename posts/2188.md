### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate over all possible combinations of tire types and laps and keep track of the minimum time required to finish the race.

1. Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(numLaps + 1) x tires.length` to store the minimum time to finish `i` laps with each tire type.
2. Initialize the first row of `dp` with the time taken to finish the first lap with each tire type.
3. Iterate over laps starting from the second lap:
   - For each lap, iterate over tire types and calculate the minimum time to finish the lap considering changing the tire or continuing with the current tire.
4. The answer will be the minimum time taken to finish `numLaps` laps with any tire type.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(numLaps * tires.length) as we are iterating over all possible combinations.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(numLaps * tires.length) for the `dp` array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToFinishRace(int[][] tires, int changeTime, int numLaps) {
        int n = tires.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[numLaps + 1][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[1][i] = tires[i][0];
        }
        
        for (int lap = 2; lap <= numLaps; lap++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                dp[lap][i] = Math.min(dp[lap - 1][i] + tires[i][0], dp[lap - 1][(i + 1) % n] + changeTime + tires[i][0]);
            }
        }
        
        int minTime = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minTime = Math.min(minTime, dp[numLaps][i]);
        }
        
        return minTime;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToFinishRace(vector<vector<int>>& tires, int changeTime, int numLaps) {
        int n = tires.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(numLaps + 1, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[1][i] = tires[i][0];
        }
        
        for (int lap = 2; lap <= numLaps; lap++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                dp[lap][i] = min(dp[lap - 1][i] + tires[i][0], dp[lap - 1][(i + 1) % n] + changeTime + tires[i][0]);
            }
        }
        
        int minTime = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minTime = min(minTime, dp[numLaps][i]);
        }
        
        return minTime;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToFinishRace(self, tires: List[List[int]], changeTime: int, numLaps: int) -> int:
        n = len(tires)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(numLaps + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            dp[1][i] = tires[i][0]
        
        for lap in range(2, numLaps + 1):
            for i in range(n):
                dp[lap][i] = min(dp[lap - 1][i] + tires[i][0], dp[lap - 1][(i + 1) % n] + changeTime + tires[i][0])
        
        minTime = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            minTime = min(minTime, dp[numLaps][i])
        
        return minTime
