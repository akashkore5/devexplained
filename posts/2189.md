## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a 2D array `dp[i][j]` to represent the number of ways to build a house of cards with `i` floors and `j` cards. The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`.

To calculate `dp[i][j]`, we need to consider two cases:
1. If we use the current card to form the roof of the house, then the remaining cards can be used to build a house with `i-1` floors and `j-1` cards. So, `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]`.
2. If we use the current card to form the walls of the house, then the remaining cards can be used to build a house with `i-1` floors and `j` cards. So, `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]`.

The final answer will be the sum of all `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the number of floors and `k` is the total number of cards.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n*k), where n is the number of floors and k is the total number of cards.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n*k) for the 2D array `dp`.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int buildHouseOfCards(int n, int k) {
        int mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][k+1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]) % mod;
            }
        }
        
        int ways = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            ways = (ways + dp[n][i]) % mod;
        }
        
        return ways;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int buildHouseOfCards(int n, int k) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]) % mod;
            }
        }
        
        int ways = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            ways = (ways + dp[n][i]) % mod;
        }
        
        return ways;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def buildHouseOfCards(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, k+1):
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]) % mod
        
        ways = 0
        for i in range(k+1):
            ways = (ways + dp[n][i]) % mod
        
        return ways
```
