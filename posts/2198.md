### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the number of unique triplets (a, b, c) where a, b, and c are positive integers and a divides b and b divides c.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible triplets and check if the conditions are satisfied. We can do this by generating all divisors for each number and checking if they meet the criteria.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.
2. Iterate through all possible triplets (a, b, c) where 1 <= a < b < c <= n.
3. For each triplet, find all divisors of a, b, and c.
4. Check if a divides b and b divides c. If both conditions are met, increment the `count`.
5. Return the final count of valid triplets.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2 * sqrt(n)) where n is the given integer.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriplets(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) {
                for (int c = b + 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    if (b % a == 0 && c % b == 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTriplets(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = a + 1; b <= n; b++) {
                for (int c = b + 1; c <= n; c++) {
                    if (b % a == 0 && c % b == 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n):
            for b in range(a + 1, n):
                for c in range(b + 1, n):
                    if b % a == 0 and c % b == 0:
                        count += 1
        return count
```
