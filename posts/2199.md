### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a graph-based approach. We can model the given posts and their topics as nodes and edges in a directed graph. Then, we can perform a topological sort to determine the topic of each post. The key idea is to construct the graph based on the provided post dependencies and then perform a topological sort to find the order of topics.

#### Algorithm:
1. Create a graph where each node represents a post and each directed edge (u, v) indicates that post u depends on post v.
2. Perform a topological sort on the graph to get the order of posts/topics.
3. Assign topics to posts based on the topological order obtained.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of posts/topics and E is the number of dependencies between posts.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V + E) to store the graph and perform the topological sort.

class Solution {
    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int[] prerequisite : prerequisites) {
            int course = prerequisite[0];
            int prereq = prerequisite[1];
            graph[prereq].add(course);
            indegree[course]++;
        }

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
