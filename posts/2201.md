### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the excavation process and keep track of the uncovered parts of each artifact. We can use a set to store the coordinates of the excavated cells and iterate through the artifacts to check if all their parts are uncovered. If all parts of an artifact are uncovered, we increment the count of extractable artifacts.

- We initialize a set `excavated` to store excavated cell coordinates.
- We iterate through the `dig` array and add the excavated cells to the `excavated` set.
- We iterate through the artifacts and check if all parts are uncovered by comparing the cell coordinates with the `excavated` set.
- If all parts are uncovered, we increment the count of extractable artifacts.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of artifacts  
Space complexity: O(n) for the set and storing artifact details
```java
class Solution {
    public int countArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        Set<String> excavated = new HashSet<>();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int[] d : dig) {
            excavated.add(d[0] + "," + d[1]);
        }
        
        for (int[] artifact : artifacts) {
            int r1 = artifact[0], c1 = artifact[1];
            int r2 = artifact[2], c2 = artifact[3];
            boolean uncovered = true;
            
            for (int i = r1; i <= r2; i++) {
                for (int j = c1; j <= c2; j++) {
                    if (!excavated.contains(i + "," + j)) {
