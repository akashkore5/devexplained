## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given list of prices and check if the price is greater than or equal to the discount threshold. If it is, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of users eligible for a discount. Finally, we return the count of eligible users.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter variable `eligibleUsers` to 0.
2. Iterate through the list of prices.
3. For each price, if the price is greater than or equal to the discount threshold, increment the `eligibleUsers` counter.
4. Return the `eligibleUsers` count as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of prices in the input list.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
public int countUsersWithDiscount(List<Integer> prices, int discountThreshold) {
    int eligibleUsers = 0;
    for (int price : prices) {
        if (price >= discountThreshold) {
            eligibleUsers++;
        }
    }
    return eligibleUsers;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int countUsersWithDiscount(vector<int>& prices, int discountThreshold) {
    int eligibleUsers = 0;
    for (int price : prices) {
        if (price >= discountThreshold) {
            eligibleUsers++;
        }
    }
    return eligibleUsers;
}
```

### Python
```python
def countUsersWithDiscount(prices, discountThreshold):
    eligibleUsers = 0
    for price in prices:
        if price >= discountThreshold:
            eligibleUsers += 1
    return eligibleUsers
```
