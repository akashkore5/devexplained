### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the cars from left to right. For each car, we check if it is moving left or right. If it is moving right, we store its position. If it is moving left, we check if there are any cars that were moving right and have not collided yet. If there are, we calculate the collisions and update the total count. We repeat this process for all cars.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize variables `collisions` to 0 and an empty set `carsMovingRight`.
2. Iterate through the cars:
   - If car i is moving right, add its position to `carsMovingRight`.
   - If car i is moving left:
     - Check for any cars moving right that haven't collided yet.
     - Update `collisions` accordingly.
3. Return the total `collisions`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of cars.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the set of cars moving right.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countCollisions(String directions) {
        int collisions = 0;
        Set<Integer> carsMovingRight = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < directions.length(); i++) {
            if (directions.charAt(i) == 'R') {
                carsMovingRight.add(i);
            } else if (directions.charAt(i) == 'L') {
                for (int pos : carsMovingRight) {
                    if (pos < i) {
                        collisions += 2;
                    } else {
                        collisions++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return collisions;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCollisions(string directions) {
        int collisions = 0;
        unordered_set<int> carsMovingRight;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < directions.size(); i++) {
            if (directions[i] == 'R') {
                carsMovingRight.insert(i);
            } else if (directions[i] == 'L') {
                for (auto pos : carsMovingRight) {
                    if (pos < i) {
                        collisions += 2;
                    } else {
                        collisions++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return collisions;
    }
};
```

```python

    def countCollisions(self, directions: str) -> int:
        collisions = 0
        cars_moving_right = set()
        
        for i in range(len(directions)):
            if directions[i] == 'R':
                cars_moving_right.add(i)
            elif directions[i] == 'L':
                for pos in cars_moving_right:
                    if pos < i:
                        collisions += 2
                    else:
                        collisions += 1
