## Explanation

To maximize Bob's points, we need to distribute the arrows he shoots in a way that he gains the highest possible score compared to Alice. The idea is to iterate through each scoring section and decide how many arrows Bob should shoot to maximize his points.

We can achieve this by first calculating the maximum possible points Alice can score, then distributing Bob's arrows in a way that maximizes his points while ensuring that the total number of arrows Bob shoots is equal to `numArrows`.

The time complexity of this approach is O(12) = O(1) since we always iterate through a fixed number of scoring sections. The space complexity is also O(12) = O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the arrow distribution for Bob.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxPoints(int numArrows, int[] aliceArrows) {
        int[] bobArrows = new int[12];
        int alicePoints = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
            alicePoints += aliceArrows[i] * i;
        }
        
        int remainingArrows = numArrows;
        for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
            int maxBobArrows = Math.min(remainingArrows, aliceArrows[i]);
            bobArrows[i] = maxBobArrows;
            remainingArrows -= maxBobArrows;
        }
        
        return bobArrows;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxPoints(int numArrows, vector<int>& aliceArrows) {
        vector<int> bobArrows(12, 0);
        int alicePoints = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
            alicePoints += aliceArrows[i] * i;
        }
        
        int remainingArrows = numArrows;
        for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
            int maxBobArrows = min(remainingArrows, aliceArrows[i]);
            bobArrows[i] = maxBobArrows;
            remainingArrows -= maxBobArrows;
        }
        
        return bobArrows;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, numArrows: int, aliceArrows: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        bobArrows = [0] * 12
        alicePoints = sum([i * aliceArrows[i] for i in range(12)])
        
        remainingArrows = numArrows
        for i in range(12):
            maxBobArrows = min(remainingArrows, aliceArrows[i])
            bobArrows[i] = maxBobArrows
            remainingArrows -= maxBobArrows
        
        return bobArrows
```
