## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can start from the bottom-right corner of the dungeon and calculate the minimum health required to reach the princess. We can iterate backward through the dungeon, calculating the minimum health required to reach each cell.

At each cell, we need to calculate the minimum health needed to reach the princess from that cell. We can calculate this minimum health based on the health required to move to the next cell and the health available at that cell.

If the health available at a cell is greater than the health required to move to the next cell, then the minimum health required is 1. Otherwise, we need to calculate the difference between the health required to move to the next cell and the health available at the current cell.

The final answer will be the minimum health required to reach the princess from the starting cell.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the dungeon.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(m*n) as well, as we use a 2D dp array to store the minimum health required at each cell.

:
:
```java
public int calculateMinimumHP(int[][] dungeon) {
    int m = dungeon.length;
    int n = dungeon[0].length;
    
    int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
    
    dp[m-1][n-1] = Math.max(1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1], 1);
    
    for (int i = m-2; i >= 0; i--) {
        dp[i][n-1] = Math.max(dp[i+1][n-1] - dungeon[i][n-1], 1);
    }
    
    for (int j = n-2; j >= 0; j--) {
        dp[m-1][j] = Math.max(dp[m-1][j+1] - dungeon[m-1][j], 1);
    }
    
    for (int i = m-2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = n-2; j >= 0; j--) {
            int minHealth = Math.min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]);
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(minHealth - dungeon[i][j], 1);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][0];
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
int calculateMinimumHP(vector<vector<int>>& dungeon) {
    int m = dungeon.size();
    int n = dungeon[0].size();
    
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n));
    
    dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1], 1);
    
    for (int i = m-2; i >= 0; i--) {
        dp[i][n-1] = max(dp[i+1][n-1] - dungeon[i][n-1], 1);
    }
    
    for (int j = n-2; j >= 0; j--) {
        dp[m-1][j] = max(dp[m-1][j+1] - dungeon[m-1][j], 1);
    }
    
    for (int i = m-2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = n-2; j >= 0; j--) {
            int minHealth = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]);
            dp[i][j] = max(minHealth - dungeon[i][j], 1);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][0];
}
```

### Python:
```python
def calculateMinimumHP(dungeon):
    m = len(dungeon)
    n = len(dungeon[0])
    
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[m-1][n-1] = max(1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1], 1)
    
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        dp[i][n-1] = max(dp[i+1][n-1] - dungeon[i][n-1], 1)
    
    for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        dp[m-1][j] = max(dp[m-1][j+1] - dungeon[m-1][j], 1)
    
    for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            minHealth = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
            dp[i][j] = max(minHealth - dungeon[i][j], 1)
    
    return dp[0][0]
