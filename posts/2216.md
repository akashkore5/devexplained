### Explanation
To make the array beautiful, we need to ensure that the length is even and no adjacent elements are the same. We can achieve this by iterating through the array and counting the number of deletions needed to fix the violations of the beauty condition. We can then return the minimum number of deletions required.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `deletions` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1) and check if the current element is equal to the previous element. If it is, increment `deletions`.
3. After the loop, return `deletions`.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array.
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletions(int[] nums) {
        int deletions = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
                deletions++;
            }
        }
        return deletions;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletions(vector<int>& nums) {
        int deletions = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
                deletions++;
            }
        }
        return deletions;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        deletions = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                deletions += 1
        return deletions
```
