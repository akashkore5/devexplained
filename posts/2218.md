## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total value of coins we can obtain by choosing exactly `k` coins. We can achieve this by sorting the coins in each pile in descending order and then greedily picking the top coin from each pile in a way that maximizes our total value. We start by choosing the top `k` coins from the first pile, then iteratively choose the top coin from the pile with the highest remaining value until we have chosen `k` coins.

### Algorithm:
1. Sort all piles in descending order based on the values of coins.
2. Initialize the total value variable to 0.
3. Iterate over the piles and greedily choose the top coin from each pile until we have chosen `k` coins.
4. Return the total value obtained.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * log(n)) where n is the total number of coins in all piles, as we sort each pile.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted piles.
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[][] piles, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(piles, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        
        int totalValue = 0;
        int remaining = k;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < piles.length && remaining > 0; i++) {
            totalValue += piles[i][0];
            remaining--;
        }
        
        return totalValue;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& piles, int k) {
        std::sort(piles.begin(), piles.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] > b[0];
        });
        
        int totalValue = 0;
        int remaining = k;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < piles.size() && remaining > 0; i++) {
            totalValue += piles[i][0];
            remaining--;
        }
        
        return totalValue;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, piles: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        piles.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
        
        total_value = 0
        remaining = k
        
        for i in range(len(piles)):
            if remaining <= 0:
                break
            total_value += piles[i][0]
            remaining -= 1
            
        return total_value
```
