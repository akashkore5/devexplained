### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the maximum sum of a score we can get by performing operations on an array. We are allowed to choose two numbers at a time and perform the following operations:
- Multiply one of the chosen numbers by 2.
- Multiply one of the chosen numbers by 3.
- Add one to one of the chosen numbers.

We need to find the maximum possible sum of the score after performing these operations on the array.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum score we can get for each element in the array. We will maintain two arrays:
- `maxScores`: Stores the maximum score we can achieve for each element by choosing that element as the second number.
- `dp`: Stores the maximum score we can achieve for each element by choosing that element as the first number.

At each step, we update `dp[i]` based on the maximum scores we have calculated so far. The final answer will be the maximum score in the `dp` array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] maxScores = new int[n];
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        
        maxScores[n - 1] = nums[n - 1] * 2;
        dp[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxScores[i] = Math.max(nums[i] * 2 + maxScores[i + 1], nums[i] * 3 + dp[i + 1]);
            dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i] + dp[i + 1], nums[i] * 2);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> maxScores(n);
        vector<int> dp(n);
        
        maxScores[n - 1] = nums[n - 1] * 2;
        dp[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxScores[i] = max(nums[i] * 2 + maxScores[i + 1], nums[i] * 3 + dp[i + 1]);
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i + 1], nums[i] * 2);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        maxScores = [0] * n
        dp = [0] * n
        
        maxScores[n - 1] = nums[n - 1] * 2
        dp[n - 1] = nums[n - 1]
        
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            maxScores[i] = max(nums[i] * 2 + maxScores[i + 1], nums[i] * 3 + dp[i + 1])
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i + 1], nums[i] * 2)
        
        return dp[0]
```
