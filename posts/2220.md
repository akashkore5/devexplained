## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the bits of the `start` and `goal` numbers from right to left. If the corresponding bits are different, we need to perform a bit flip operation. We can use a simple greedy approach where we flip the current bit if it differs between the two numbers, and then continue to the next bit.

The steps to convert `start` to `goal` will be equal to the number of bit flips required.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(N)), where N is the maximum of `start` and `goal`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int flips = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((start & 1) != (goal & 1)) {
                flips++;
            }
            start >>= 1;
            goal >>= 1;
        }
        return flips;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int flips = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((start & 1) != (goal & 1)) {
                flips++;
            }
            start >>= 1;
            goal >>= 1;
        }
        return flips;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, start: int, goal: int) -> int:
        flips = 0
        for i in range(32):
            if (start & 1) != (goal & 1):
                flips += 1
            start >>= 1
            goal >>= 1
        return flips
```
