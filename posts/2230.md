### Explanation:
We are given a list of integers representing the purchase amounts of users. Users are eligible for a discount if their purchase amount is greater than or equal to $100. We need to return a list of users who are eligible for a discount.

To solve this problem, we iterate through the list of purchase amounts and check if each amount is greater than or equal to $100. If it is, we add the index of that user to our result list.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of users
- Space complexity: O(1) if we ignore the space used for the result list

:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> usersWithDiscount(List<Integer> purchaseAmounts) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < purchaseAmounts.size(); i++) {
            if (purchaseAmounts.get(i) >= 100) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> usersWithDiscount(std::vector<int>& purchaseAmounts) {
        std::vector<int> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < purchaseAmounts.size(); i++) {
            if (purchaseAmounts[i] >= 100) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def usersWithDiscount(self, purchaseAmounts: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        
        for i in range(len(purchaseAmounts)):
            if purchaseAmounts[i] >= 100:
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
```
