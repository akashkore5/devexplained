## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the total beauty, the number of complete gardens, and the minimum number of flowers in any incomplete garden.
2. Iterate through the gardens and calculate the total beauty based on the current state.
3. Keep planting flowers in the incomplete gardens until we have planted all newFlowers or all gardens are complete.
4. Calculate the total beauty based on the final state after planting the flowers.
5. Return the maximum total beauty obtained.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTotalBeauty(int[] flowers, int newFlowers, int target, int full, int partial) {
        int totalBeauty = 0;
        int completeGardens = 0;
        int minIncomplete = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int flower : flowers) {
            if (flower >= target) {
                totalBeauty += full;
                completeGardens++;
            } else {
                minIncomplete = Math.min(minIncomplete, flower);
            }
        }
        
        int remainingFlowers = newFlowers;
        while (remainingFlowers > 0 && minIncomplete < target) {
            totalBeauty += partial;
            minIncomplete++;
            remainingFlowers--;
        }
