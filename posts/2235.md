### Explanation
To add two integers `num1` and `num2`, we can simply use the `+` operator in all three languages. The sum of `num1` and `num2` will be returned as the result.

- Time complexity: O(1) as the addition operation is constant time.
- Space complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used.

```java
class Solution {
    public int addTwoIntegers(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int addTwoIntegers(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def addTwoIntegers(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        return num1 + num2
```
