## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of trips and maintain a map to keep track of the number of times each driver was a passenger. For each trip, we update the count for the driver and the passenger accordingly. Finally, we return the count for the given driver.

1. Initialize a hashmap to store the count of each driver as a passenger.
2. Iterate through the list of trips:
   - For each trip, update the count of the driver and passenger.
3. Return the count for the given driver.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N) where N is the number of trips.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(N) to store the count of each driver.
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int numOfTimesDriverWasPassenger(int driver, List<List<Integer>> trips) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> passengerCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (List<Integer> trip : trips) {
            int driverTrip = trip.get(0);
            int passengerTrip = trip.get(1);
            
            passengerCount.put(driverTrip, passengerCount.getOrDefault(driverTrip, 0) + 1);
            passengerCount.put(passengerTrip, passengerCount.getOrDefault(passengerTrip, 0) - 1);
        }
        
        return passengerCount.getOrDefault(driver, 0);
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfTimesDriverWasPassenger(int driver, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& trips) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> passengerCount;
        
        for (const auto& trip : trips) {
            int driverTrip = trip[0];
            int passengerTrip = trip[1];
            
            passengerCount[driverTrip] += 1;
            passengerCount[passengerTrip] -= 1;
        }
        
        return passengerCount[driver];
    }
};
```

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numOfTimesDriverWasPassenger(self, driver: int, trips: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        passenger_count = {}
        
        for trip in trips:
            driver_trip, passenger_trip = trip[0], trip[1]
            passenger_count[driver_trip] = passenger_count.get(driver_trip, 0) + 1
            passenger_count[passenger_trip] = passenger_count.get(passenger_trip, 0) - 1
        
        return passenger_count.get(driver, 0)
```
