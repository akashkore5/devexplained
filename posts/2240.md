## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible combinations of pens and pencils that can be bought within the given total amount of money. We can use a nested loop to iterate through the number of pens and pencils bought, checking if the total cost is within the available money. If it is, we increment the count of ways to buy pens and pencils.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `ways` to 0 to count the number of ways to buy pens and pencils.
2. Iterate `pens` from 0 to total/cost1 (maximum number of pens that can be bought).
3. Inside the pens loop, iterate `pencils` from 0 to total/cost2 (maximum number of pencils that can be bought).
4. If the total cost of buying `pens` pens and `pencils` pencils is less than or equal to the total amount, increment the `ways`.
5. Return the final count of `ways`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(total^2) as we are iterating through all possible combinations of pens and pencils.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of space for variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaysToBuyPensAndPencils(int total, int cost1, int cost2) {
        int ways = 0;
        for (int pens = 0; pens <= total / cost1; pens++) {
            for (int pencils = 0; pencils <= total / cost2; pencils++) {
                if (cost1 * pens + cost2 * pencils <= total) {
                    ways++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaysToBuyPensAndPencils(int total, int cost1, int cost2) {
        int ways = 0;
        for (int pens = 0; pens <= total / cost1; pens++) {
            for (int pencils = 0; pencils <= total / cost2; pencils++) {
                if (cost1 * pens + cost2 * pencils <= total) {
                    ways++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numWaysToBuyPensAndPencils(self, total: int, cost1: int, cost2: int) -> int:
        ways = 0
        for pens in range(total // cost1 + 1):
            for pencils in range(total // cost2 + 1):
                if cost1 * pens + cost2 * pencils <= total:
                    ways += 1
        return ways
