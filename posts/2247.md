## Explanation:

This problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph with positive weights. We can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to keep track of the maximum cost while traversing the graph. The idea is to maintain a priority queue to store the vertices to be explored next based on their cost.

1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph where each edge has a weight representing the cost.
2. Initialize an array to keep track of the maximum cost to reach each node, initially set to negative infinity except for the starting node which is set to 0.
3. Initialize a priority queue to store vertices based on their maximum cost.
4. Start with the starting node, update the maximum cost to reach neighboring nodes if the cost is greater and add them to the priority queue.
5. Repeat the process until the priority queue is empty.

Time complexity: O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Edge {
    int to;
    int cost;

    public Edge(int to, int cost) {
        this.to = to;
        this.cost = cost;
    }
}

public int maxCost(int n, int k, int[][] highways) {
    List<List<Edge>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
    }

    for (int[] highway : highways) {
        int from = highway[0];
        int to = highway[1];
        int cost = highway[2];
        graph.get(from).add(new Edge(to, cost));
    }

    PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[1], a[1]));
    int[] maxCost = new int[n];
    Arrays.fill(maxCost, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    maxCost[0] = 0;
    pq.offer(new int[]{0, 0});

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        int[] curr = pq.poll();
        int node = curr[0];
        int cost = curr[1];

        if (cost < maxCost[node]) continue;

        for (Edge edge : graph.get(node)) {
            int neighbor = edge.to;
            int newCost = cost + edge.cost;

            if (newCost > maxCost[neighbor]) {
                maxCost[neighbor] = newCost;
                pq.offer(new int[]{neighbor, newCost});
            }
        }
    }

    return maxCost[n - 1];
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int to;
    int cost;

    Edge(int to, int cost) : to(to), cost(cost) {}
};

int maxCost(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& highways) {
    vector<vector<Edge>> graph(n);
    for (const auto& highway : highways) {
        int from = highway[0];
        int to = highway[1];
        int cost = highway[2];
        graph[from].emplace_back(to, cost);
    }

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
    vector<int> maxCost(n, INT_MIN);
    maxCost[0] = 0;
    pq.push({0, 0});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [node, cost] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (cost < maxCost[node]) continue;

        for (const auto& edge : graph[node]) {
            int neighbor = edge.to;
            int newCost = cost + edge.cost;

            if (newCost > maxCost[neighbor]) {
                maxCost[neighbor] = newCost;
                pq.push({neighbor, newCost});
            }
        }
    }

    return maxCost[n - 1];
}
```

### Python:
```python
import heapq

class Edge:
    def __init__(self, to, cost):
        self.to = to
        self.cost = cost

def maxCost(n, k, highways):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for highway in highways:
        from_node, to_node, cost = highway
        graph[from_node].append(Edge(to_node, cost))

    pq = [(-float("inf"), 0)]
    max_cost = [-float("inf")] * n
    max_cost[0] = 0

    while pq:
        cost, node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if cost < max_cost[node]:
            continue

        for edge in graph[node]:
            neighbor = edge.to
            new_cost = cost + edge.cost

            if new_cost > max_cost[neighbor]:
                max_cost[neighbor] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (-new_cost, neighbor))

    return max_cost[n - 1]
