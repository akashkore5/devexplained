### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each point and count how many rectangles contain that point. For each point, we check if it lies within each rectangle by comparing its coordinates with the rectangle's dimensions. If the point lies within a rectangle, we increment the count for that point.

- Algorithm:
  1. Initialize an array `count` of size equal to the number of points, initially filled with zeros.
  2. For each point in the `points` array, iterate through each rectangle in the `rectangles` array.
  3. Check if the point lies within the rectangle by comparing its x and y coordinates with the rectangle's dimensions.
  4. If the point lies within the rectangle, increment the count for that point.
  5. Return the `count` array as the final result.

- Time Complexity: O(N*M) where N is the number of points and M is the number of rectangles.
- Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of points.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countPoints(int[][] rectangles, int[][] points) {
        int[] count = new int[points.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rectangles.length; j++) {
                if (points[i][0] >= 0 && points[i][0] <= rectangles[j][0] &&
                    points[i][1] >= 0 && points[i][1] <= rectangles[j][1]) {
                    count[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countPoints(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles, vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        vector<int> count(points.size(), 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rectangles.size(); j++) {
                if (points[i][0] >= 0 && points[i][0] <= rectangles[j][0] &&
                    points[i][1] >= 0 && points[i][1] <= rectangles[j][1]) {
                    count[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countPoints(self, rectangles: List[List[int]], points: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        count = [0] * len(points)
        
        for i in range(len(points)):
            for j in range(len(rectangles)):
                if points[i][0] >= 0 and points[i][0] <= rectangles[j][0] and points[i][1] >= 0 and points[i][1] <= rectangles[j][1]:
                    count[i] += 1
        
        return count
```
