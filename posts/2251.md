### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can first preprocess the flower bloom times by sorting them based on their start times. Then, we can iterate over the people's arrival times and use a binary search to find the number of flowers in bloom at that specific time.

1. Sort the flowers array based on the start times.
2. Iterate over the people array.
3. For each person, use binary search to find the number of flowers in bloom at the arrival time.
4. Return the count of flowers in bloom for each person.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) for sorting the flowers array and O(n log n) for binary search for each person, where n is the number of flowers.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted flowers array.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] numOfBloomFlowers(int[][] flowers, int[] people) {
        Arrays.sort(flowers, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int n = flowers.length;
        int[] result = new int[people.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
            int count = binarySearch(flowers, people[i]);
            result[i] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int binarySearch(int[][] flowers, int time) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] flower : flowers) {
            if (flower[0] <= time && time <= flower[1]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numOfBloomFlowers(vector<vector<int>>& flowers, vector<int>& people) {
        sort(flowers.begin(), flowers.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++) {
            int count = binarySearch(flowers, people[i]);
            result.push_back(count);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    int binarySearch(vector<vector<int>>& flowers, int time) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& flower : flowers) {
            if (flower[0] <= time && time <= flower[1]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfBloomFlowers(self, flowers: List[List[int]], people: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        flowers.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        result = []
        
        for p in people:
            count = self.binarySearch(flowers, p)
            result.append(count)
        
        return result
    
    def binarySearch(self, flowers: List[List[int]], time: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for flower in flowers:
            if flower[0] <= time <= flower[1]:
                count += 1
        
        return count
