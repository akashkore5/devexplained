## Explanation

To design a video sharing platform, we can implement a system that handles user accounts, video uploads, video viewing, and video sharing. We can use various data structures like HashMaps, Sets, and lists to store and manage user information, video metadata, and relationships between users and videos.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Create classes for User, Video, and VideoPlatform to represent users, videos, and the video sharing platform.
2. Use HashMaps to store user information (user ID to User object), video metadata (video ID to Video object), and relationships like videos uploaded by a user and videos viewed by a user.
3. Implement methods in VideoPlatform class for functionalities like user registration, video upload, video viewing, video sharing, etc.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of various operations like user registration, video upload, video viewing, and video sharing will depend on the underlying data structures used.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity will depend on the number of users, videos, and relationships stored in memory.
```java
import java.util.*;

class User {
    private int userId;
    private String username;
    // Other user-related fields and methods

    public User(int userId, String username) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.username = username;
    }
}

class Video {
    private int videoId;
    private String title;
    // Other video metadata fields and methods

    public Video(int videoId, String title) {
        this.videoId = videoId;
        this.title = title;
    }
}

class VideoPlatform {
    private Map<Integer, User> users;
    private Map<Integer, Video> videos;
    private Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> userUploadedVideos;
    private Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> userViewedVideos;
    // Other data structures and methods for handling video sharing platform functionalities

    public VideoPlatform() {
        users = new HashMap<>();
        videos = new HashMap<>();
        userUploadedVideos = new HashMap<>();
        userViewedVideos = new HashMap<>();
    }

    // Implement methods for user registration, video upload, video viewing, video sharing, etc.
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

class User {
private:
    int userId;
    std::string username;
    // Other user-related fields and methods

public:
    User(int userId, std::string username) : userId(userId), username(username) {}
};

class Video {
private:
    int videoId;
    std::string title;
    // Other video metadata fields and methods

public:
    Video(int videoId, std::string title) : videoId(videoId), title(title) {}
};

class VideoPlatform {
private:
    std::unordered_map<int, User> users;
    std::unordered_map<int, Video> videos;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_set<int>> userUploadedVideos;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_set<int>> userViewedVideos;
    // Other data structures and methods for handling video sharing platform functionalities

public:
    VideoPlatform() {}

    // Implement methods for user registration, video upload, video viewing, video sharing, etc.
};
```

### Python
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, userId, username):
        self.userId = userId
        self.username = username
        # Other user-related fields and methods

class Video:
    def __init__(self, videoId, title):
        self.videoId = videoId
        self.title = title
        # Other video metadata fields and methods

class VideoPlatform:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}
        self.videos = {}
        self.userUploadedVideos = {}
        self.userViewedVideos = {}
        # Other data structures and methods for handling video sharing platform functionalities

    # Implement methods for user registration, video upload, video viewing, video sharing, etc.
```
