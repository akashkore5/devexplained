## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all substrings of the input string `s` and calculate the appeal of each substring. We can do this by maintaining a frequency array to count the occurrences of each character within the current substring. Then, we iterate over all possible substrings of different lengths and calculate the total appeal.

- Initialize a variable `totalAppeal` to store the sum of appeals of all substrings.
- Iterate over all possible starting positions `i` from 0 to `n-1` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- For each starting position `i`, iterate over all possible ending positions `j` from `i` to `n-1`.
- For each substring from position `i` to `j`, maintain a frequency array to count the occurrences of each character.
- Calculate the appeal of the current substring as the number of unique characters in the frequency array.
- Update the `totalAppeal` by adding the appeal of the current substring.
- Finally, return the `totalAppeal`.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string `s`. The space complexity is O(26) for the frequency array, which is constant.
```java
class Solution {
    public int totalAppeal(String s) {
        int totalAppeal = 0;
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int[] freq = new int[26];
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                freq[s.charAt(j) - 'a']++;
                int appeal = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                    if (freq[k] > 0) {
                        appeal++;
                    }
                }
                totalAppeal += appeal;
            }
        }

        return totalAppeal;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalAppeal(string s) {
        int totalAppeal = 0;
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            vector<int> freq(26, 0);
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                freq[s[j] - 'a']++;
                int appeal = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                    if (freq[k] > 0) {
                        appeal++;
                    }
                }
                totalAppeal += appeal;
            }
        }

        return totalAppeal;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def totalAppeal(self, s: str) -> int:
        totalAppeal = 0
        n = len(s)

        for i in range(n):
            freq = [0] * 26
            for j in range(i, n):
                freq[ord(s[j]) - ord('a')] += 1
                appeal = sum(1 for count in freq if count > 0)
                totalAppeal += appeal

        return totalAppeal
```
