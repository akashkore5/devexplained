### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate over the given tiles and calculate the coverage for each possible starting position of the carpet. For each starting position, we calculate the number of white tiles covered by the carpet. We keep track of the maximum number of white tiles covered and return that as the result.

1. Sort the tiles based on their starting positions.
2. Iterate over the sorted tiles:
   - For each tile, calculate the coverage of the carpet starting at this tile.
   - Update the maximum coverage if the current coverage is greater.
3. Return the maximum coverage.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of tiles. Sorting the tiles takes O(n log n) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxWhiteTilesCovered(int[][] tiles, int carpetLen) {
        Arrays.sort(tiles, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int maxCovered = 0;
        for (int[] tile : tiles) {
            int start = tile[0];
            int end = tile[1];
            int coverage = Math.min(end - start + 1, carpetLen);
            maxCovered = Math.max(maxCovered, coverage);
        }
        return maxCovered;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWhiteTilesCovered(vector<vector<int>>& tiles, int carpetLen) {
        sort(tiles.begin(), tiles.end());
        int maxCovered = 0;
        for (const auto& tile : tiles) {
            int start = tile[0];
            int end = tile[1];
            int coverage = min(end - start + 1, carpetLen);
            maxCovered = max(maxCovered, coverage);
        }
        return maxCovered;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxWhiteTilesCovered(self, tiles: List[List[int]], carpetLen: int) -> int:
        tiles.sort()
        max_covered = 0
        for tile in tiles:
            start, end = tile
            coverage = min(end - start + 1, carpetLen)
            max_covered = max(max_covered, coverage)
        return max_covered
