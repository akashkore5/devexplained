### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each special floor and find the maximum gap between them. The maximum gap can occur at the beginning before the first special floor, in between two special floors, or at the end after the last special floor. We can calculate these gaps and return the maximum gap as the result.

- Sort the special floors array.
- Initialize maxGap to be the maximum of the first special floor index and the difference between the first special floor and the bottom floor.
- Iterate through the special floors array and calculate the gap between consecutive special floors.
- Update maxGap with the maximum of the current gap and the difference between the current special floor and the previous special floor.
- Calculate the gap between the last special floor and the top floor.
- Update maxGap with the maximum of the last gap and the difference between the top floor and the last special floor.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutiveFloors(int bottom, int top, int[] special) {
        Arrays.sort(special);
        int maxGap = Math.max(special[0] - bottom, 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < special.length; i++) {
            int gap = special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1;
            maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, gap);
        }
        
        maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, top - special[special.length - 1]);
        
        return maxGap;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxConsecutiveFloors(int bottom, int top, vector<int>& special) {
        sort(special.begin(), special.end());
        int maxGap = max(special[0] - bottom, 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < special.size(); i++) {
            int gap = special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1;
            maxGap = max(maxGap, gap);
        }
        
        maxGap = max(maxGap, top - special.back());
        
        return maxGap;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxConsecutiveFloors(self, bottom: int, top: int, special: List[int]) -> int:
        special.sort()
        max_gap = max(special[0] - bottom, 0)
        
        for i in range(1, len(special)):
            gap = special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1
            max_gap = max(max_gap, gap)
        
        max_gap = max(max_gap, top - special[-1])
        
        return max_gap
```
