### Explanation:

Given a binary tree and a list of nodes representing a path, we need to find the node in the tree that is closest to the path. The distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges on the path between them.

To solve this problem, we can traverse the tree and for each node, calculate the distance to each node in the path. We can keep track of the minimum distance encountered so far and the node corresponding to that minimum distance.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `minDistance` to infinity and `closestNode` to null.
2. Perform a depth-first search traversal of the tree.
3. For each node encountered during the traversal, calculate the distance to each node in the path.
4. Update `minDistance` and `closestNode` if a closer node is found.
5. Return the `closestNode` at the end of the traversal.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(N*M), where N is the number of nodes in the tree and M is the number of nodes in the path.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this approach is O(H), where H is the height of the tree.

            int distance = getDistance(node, target);
