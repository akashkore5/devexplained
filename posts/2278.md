### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given string `s` and count the number of occurrences of the character `letter`. Then we calculate the percentage of occurrences of `letter` in `s` and round it down to the nearest whole percentage.

1. Initialize a variable `count` to store the number of occurrences of `letter`.
2. Iterate through each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is equal to `letter`, increment the `count`.
3. Calculate the percentage of occurrences of `letter` in `s` by dividing `count` by the length of `s` and multiplying by 100.
4. Return the rounded down value of the percentage.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int percentageOfLetterInString(String s, char letter) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == letter) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count * 100 / s.length();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int percentageOfLetterInString(string s, char letter) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == letter) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count * 100 / s.length();
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def percentageOfLetterInString(self, s: str, letter: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == letter:
                count += 1
        return count * 100 // len(s)
```
