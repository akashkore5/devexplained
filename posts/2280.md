### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given array of stock prices and find the points where the price changes. Whenever the price changes, we increment the count of lines needed to represent the line chart. The minimum number of lines needed will be the count of these points where the price changes.

1. Initialize a variable `lines` to store the count of lines needed.
2. Iterate through the stock prices array and compare the price of the current day with the price of the previous day.
3. If the price changes, increment the `lines` by 1.
4. Return the final value of `lines` as the minimum number of lines needed.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of stock prices.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minLines(int[][] stockPrices) {
        if (stockPrices.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int lines = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < stockPrices.length; i++) {
            if (stockPrices[i][1] != stockPrices[i - 1][1]) {
                lines++;
            }
        }
        
        return lines;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minLines(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& stockPrices) {
        if (stockPrices.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int lines = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < stockPrices.size(); i++) {
            if (stockPrices[i][1] != stockPrices[i - 1][1]) {
                lines++;
            }
        }
        
        return lines;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def min_lines(self, stockPrices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not stockPrices:
            return 0
        
        lines = 1
        for i in range(1, len(stockPrices)):
            if stockPrices[i][1] != stockPrices[i - 1][1]:
                lines += 1
        
        return lines
```
