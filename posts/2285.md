### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. We want to assign values to cities in such a way that the total importance of all roads is maximized. We can achieve this by assigning the highest values to cities that are most frequently connected by roads.

1. Create a map to store the frequency of each city appearing in the roads array.
2. Sort the cities based on their frequency in descending order.
3. Assign values starting from the highest value to the most frequent city, then decrement the value for subsequent cities.
4. Calculate the total importance of roads by summing the importance of each road.

**Time Complexity:**  
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) where n is the number of cities.

**Space Complexity:**  
The space complexity is O(n) to store the frequency map.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTotalImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            freqMap.put(road[0], freqMap.getOrDefault(road[0], 0) + 1);
            freqMap.put(road[1], freqMap.getOrDefault(road[1], 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Integer> cities = new ArrayList<>(freqMap.keySet());
        cities.sort((a, b) -> freqMap.get(b) - freqMap.get(a));

        int[] values = new int[n];
        int value = n;
        for (int city : cities) {
            values[city] = value;
            value--;
        }

        int totalImportance = 0;
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            totalImportance += values[road[0]] + values[road[1]];
        }

        return totalImportance;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTotalImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        for (auto& road : roads) {
            freqMap[road[0]]++;
            freqMap[road[1]]++;
        }

        vector<int> cities;
        for (auto& entry : freqMap) {
            cities.push_back(entry.first);
        }
        sort(cities.begin(), cities.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
            return freqMap[a] > freqMap[b];
        });

        vector<int> values(n);
        int value = n;
        for (int city : cities) {
            values[city] = value;
            value--;
        }

        int totalImportance = 0;
        for (auto& road : roads) {
            totalImportance += values[road[0]] + values[road[1]];
        }

        return totalImportance;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxTotalImportance(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        freq_map = {}
        for road in roads:
            freq_map[road[0]] = freq_map.get(road[0], 0) + 1
            freq_map[road[1]] = freq_map.get(road[1], 0) + 1

        cities = list(freq_map.keys())
        cities.sort(key=lambda x: freq_map[x], reverse=True)

        values = [0] * n
        value = n
        for city in cities:
            values[city] = value
            value -= 1

        total_importance = 0
        for road in roads:
            total_importance += values[road[0]] + values[road[1]]

        return total_importance
