### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two variables: `buy` and `sell`. We iterate over the prices array and update these variables based on the current price. At each step, we calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying at the current price and selling at a future price.

1. Initialize `buy` to a very large negative value and `sell` to 0.
2. Iterate over the prices array.
3. Update `buy` to the maximum of its current value or the negative of the current price.
4. Update `sell` to the maximum of its current value or the sum of current price and `buy`.

The final answer will be stored in the `sell` variable.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of prices in the input array.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buy = Math.max(buy, -price);
            sell = Math.max(sell, price + buy);
        }
        
        return sell;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy = INT_MIN;
        int sell = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buy = max(buy, -price);
            sell = max(sell, price + buy);
        }
        
        return sell;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy = float('-inf')
        sell = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            buy = max(buy, -price)
            sell = max(sell, price + buy)
        
        return sell
```
