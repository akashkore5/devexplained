### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list of orders and keep track of the count of orders for each product in consecutive years. We can use a hashmap to store the count of orders for each product in each year. If a product has three or more orders in two consecutive years, we add it to the result list. Finally, we return the list of products that satisfy the given condition.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of orders
- Space complexity: O(n), to store the counts of orders for each product
:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> productsWithThreeOrMoreOrders(int[] orders) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < orders.length; i += 2) {
            int productId = orders[i];
            int year = orders[i + 1];
            
            int count = countMap.getOrDefault(productId, 0);
            if (year == 1) {
                count = 0;
            }
            count++;
            countMap.put(productId, count);
            
            if (count >= 3) {
                result.add(productId);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productsWithThreeOrMoreOrders(vector<int>& orders) {
        unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < orders.size(); i += 2) {
            int productId = orders[i];
            int year = orders[i + 1];
            
            int count = countMap[productId];
            if (year == 1) {
                count = 0;
            }
            count++;
            countMap[productId] = count;
            
            if (count >= 3) {
                result.push_back(productId);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def productsWithThreeOrMoreOrders(self, orders: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        count_map = {}
        result = []
        
        for i in range(0, len(orders), 2):
            product_id = orders[i]
            year = orders[i + 1]
            
            count = count_map.get(product_id, 0)
            if year == 1:
                count = 0
            count += 1
            count_map[product_id] = count
            
            if count >= 3:
                result.append(product_id)
        
        return result
```
