## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will sort the input array `nums`, and then iteratively create subsequences by adding elements to the current subsequence until the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that subsequence exceeds `k`. At that point, we start a new subsequence and continue the process. The minimum number of subsequences will be equal to the number of times we start a new subsequence.

The steps are as follows:
1. Sort the input array `nums`.
2. Initialize a variable `res` to keep track of the number of subsequences.
3. Initialize a variable `start` to store the starting index of the current subsequence.
4. Iterate through the sorted `nums` array:
   - If the difference between the current element and the element at index `start` exceeds `k`, increment `res` and set `start` to the current index.
5. Return the value of `res`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input array. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int partitionArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 1;
        int start = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] - nums[start] > k) {
                res++;
                start = i;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int partitionArray(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int res = 1;
        int start = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] - nums[start] > k) {
                res++;
                start = i;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionArray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        res = 1
        start = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] - nums[start] > k:
                res += 1
                start = i
        
        return res
```
