## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of tasks that fall on weekends in a given range of dates. We can achieve this by iterating over the range of dates and checking if each date falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). 

1. Iterate over the range of dates.
2. Check if the current date is a Saturday or Sunday.
3. If the current date is a weekend, increment the tasks count.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of days in the given range.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.
```java
public int countWeekendTasks(int startDay, int startMonth, int startYear, int endDay, int endMonth, int endYear) {
    int count = 0;
    LocalDate startDate = LocalDate.of(startYear, startMonth, startDay);
    LocalDate endDate = LocalDate.of(endYear, endMonth, endDay);

    while (!startDate.isAfter(endDate)) {
        if (startDate.getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.SATURDAY || startDate.getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.SUNDAY) {
            count++;
        }
        startDate = startDate.plusDays(1);
    }

    return count;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>

int countWeekendTasks(int startDay, int startMonth, int startYear, int endDay, int endMonth, int endYear) {
    int count = 0;
    std::tm time = {};
    time.tm_year = startYear - 1900;
    time.tm_mon = startMonth - 1;
    time.tm_mday = startDay;

    std::time_t start = std::mktime(&time);

    time.tm_year = endYear - 1900;
    time.tm_mon = endMonth - 1;
    time.tm_mday = endDay + 1;

    std::time_t end = std::mktime(&time);

    while (start < end) {
        std::tm* date = std::localtime(&start);
        if (date->tm_wday == 0 || date->tm_wday == 6) {
            count++;
        }
        start += 86400; // add one day in seconds
    }

    return count;
}
```

```python
import datetime

def count_weekend_tasks(start_day, start_month, start_year, end_day, end_month, end_year):
    count = 0
    start_date = datetime.date(start_year, start_month, start_day)
    end_date = datetime.date(end_year, end_month, end_day)

    while start_date <= end_date:
        if start_date.weekday() == 5 or start_date.weekday() == 6:
            count += 1
        start_date += datetime.timedelta(days=1)

    return count
```
