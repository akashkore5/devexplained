## Explanation
To find the kth smallest element in a BST, we can perform an in-order traversal of the BST which will give us the elements in sorted order. While doing the in-order traversal, we keep track of the count of elements visited so far. When the count reaches k, we return the current node's value.

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of elements visited so far.
2. Perform an in-order traversal of the BST.
3. When visiting a node, increment the `count`.
4. If `count` becomes equal to `k`, return the value of the current node.
5. If not, continue the traversal until the end.
6. The kth smallest element will be the value returned when `count` equals `k`.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the BST.
Space complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the BST.
```java
class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        TreeNode current = root;
        int count = 0;

        while (current != null || !stack.isEmpty()) {
            while (current != null) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current.left;
            }

            current = stack.pop();
            count++;

            if (count == k) {
                return current.val;
            }

            current = current.right;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        stack<TreeNode*> st;
        TreeNode* current = root;
        int count = 0;

        while (current != nullptr || !st.empty()) {
            while (current != nullptr) {
                st.push(current);
                current = current->left;
            }

            current = st.top();
            st.pop();
            count++;

            if (count == k) {
                return current->val;
            }

            current = current->right;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        current = root
        count = 0

        while current or stack:
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left

            current = stack.pop()
            count += 1

            if count == k:
                return current.val

            current = current.right

        return -1
