### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, and move the `right` pointer to expand the window while keeping track of the sum and length of the current subarray. If the score of the current subarray is less than `k`, we count the number of subarrays that can be formed with the current `right` pointer position. If the score exceeds `k`, we move the `left` pointer to contract the window until the score is less than `k` again.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize pointers `left` and `right` to 0.
2. Initialize variables `sum` and `count` to 0.
3. Iterate over the array with the `right` pointer.
4. Update `sum` and `count` based on the score of the current subarray.
5. If the score exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the end of the array.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0, sum = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while (sum * (right - left + 1) >= k && left <= right) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int left = 0, sum = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += nums[right];
            while (sum * (right - left + 1) >= k && left <= right) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        left = 0
        sum_val = 0
        count = 0
        
        for right in range(n):
            sum_val += nums[right]
            while sum_val * (right - left + 1) >= k and left <= right:
                sum_val -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            count += right - left + 1
        
        return count
```
