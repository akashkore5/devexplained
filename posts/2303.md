## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the tax brackets and calculate the tax amount for each bracket based on the income. We can keep track of the remaining income and how much of it falls within each tax bracket. Finally, we sum up the tax amount for each bracket to get the total tax paid.

- Start with initializing `remainingIncome` as `income` and `totalTax` as `0.0`.
- Iterate through the tax brackets.
- For each tax bracket, calculate the taxable amount within that bracket by taking the minimum of `upperi` and `remainingIncome`.
- Calculate the tax amount for that bracket by multiplying the taxable amount with the corresponding percentage.
- Update `remainingIncome` by subtracting the taxable amount.
- Add the tax amount for the current bracket to `totalTax`.
- Continue this process until all tax brackets have been processed.
- Return `totalTax` as the final result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of tax brackets.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public double calculateAmountPaidInTaxes(int[][] brackets, int income) {
        double remainingIncome = income;
        double totalTax = 0.0;
        
        for (int[] bracket : brackets) {
            int upper = bracket[0];
            int percent = bracket[1];
            int taxableAmount = Math.min(upper, (int)remainingIncome);
            double taxAmount = taxableAmount * percent / 100.0;
            remainingIncome -= taxableAmount;
            totalTax += taxAmount;
        }
        
        return totalTax;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    double calculateAmountPaidInTaxes(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& brackets, int income) {
        double remainingIncome = income;
        double totalTax = 0.0;
        
        for (auto bracket : brackets) {
            int upper = bracket[0];
            int percent = bracket[1];
            int taxableAmount = std::min(upper, (int)remainingIncome);
            double taxAmount = taxableAmount * percent / 100.0;
            remainingIncome -= taxableAmount;
            totalTax += taxAmount;
        }
        
        return totalTax;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def calculateAmountPaidInTaxes(self, brackets, income):
        remainingIncome = income
        totalTax = 0.0
        
        for bracket in brackets:
            upper = bracket[0]
            percent = bracket[1]
            taxableAmount = min(upper, remainingIncome)
            taxAmount = taxableAmount * percent / 100.0
            remainingIncome -= taxableAmount
            totalTax += taxAmount
        
        return totalTax
```
