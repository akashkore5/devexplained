## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost of a path from the first row to the last row in the given grid. We will iterate row by row and calculate the minimum cost to reach each cell in the current row based on the minimum cost of reaching the cells in the previous row.

We will maintain a 2D array to store the minimum cost to reach each cell. At each cell, the minimum cost will be the sum of the value of the cell in the grid and the minimum cost to reach that cell from the cells in the previous row, considering the moving costs.

After iterating through all rows, the minimum cost to reach any cell in the last row will be our final answer.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n` to store the minimum cost to reach each cell.
2. Fill the first row of `dp` with the values from the first row of the grid.
3. Iterate over each row starting from the second row:
   - For each cell in the current row, calculate the minimum cost to reach that cell based on the minimum cost of reaching the cells in the previous row.
   - Update the `dp` array with the minimum cost for each cell.
4. Find the minimum cost in the last row of `dp`, which will be the minimum cost of a path from the first row to the last row.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(m * n) as we are using a 2D array to store the minimum costs.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPathCost(int[][] grid, int[][] moveCost) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + dp[i-1][0] + moveCost[grid[i-1][0]][j];
                for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], grid[i][j] + dp[i-1][k] + moveCost[grid[i-1][k]][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[m-1][j]);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& moveCost) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n));
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + dp[i-1][0] + moveCost[grid[i-1][0]][j];
                for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], grid[i][j] + dp[i-1][k] + moveCost[grid[i-1][k]][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int minCost = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            minCost = min(minCost, dp[m-1][j]);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
};
```
