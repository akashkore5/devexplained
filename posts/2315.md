## Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate through the string `s` and count the number of asterisks that are not between pairs of vertical bars. We can achieve this by keeping track of whether we are inside a pair of vertical bars or not.

- Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to store the count of asterisks.
- Initialize a boolean variable `insideBars` to false to indicate whether we are inside a pair of vertical bars or not.
- Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the current character is a vertical bar '|':
    - Toggle the value of `insideBars`.
  - If the current character is an asterisk '*' and we are not inside a pair of vertical bars:
    - Increment the count.
- Return the final count.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countAsterisks(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        boolean insideBars = false;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '|') {
                insideBars = !insideBars;
            } else if (c == '*' && !insideBars) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int countAsterisks(std::string s) {
        int count = 0;
        bool insideBars = false;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '|') {
                insideBars = !insideBars;
            } else if (c == '*' && !insideBars) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        inside_bars = False

        for c in s:
            if c == '|':
                inside_bars = not inside_bars
            elif c == '*' and not inside_bars:
                count += 1

        return count
```
