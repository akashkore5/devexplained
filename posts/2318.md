### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid sequences at each step. We can define a state dp[i][j] as the number of valid sequences of length i ending with j. We can then transition to the next state based on the constraints given in the problem.

At each step, we need to consider the valid transitions from the previous state. We can iterate over the previous state dp[i-1][k] and check if we can transition to the current state dp[i][j] based on the conditions mentioned in the problem.

After calculating the number of valid sequences for each step, we can sum up the total number of valid sequences of length n to get the final result.

Time complexity: O(n*6*6) = O(n), where n is the input integer n.
Space complexity: O(n*6)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRollsToTarget(int n, int faces, int target) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][target + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= faces; j++) {
                for (int k = j; k <= target; k++) {
                    dp[i][k] = (dp[i][k] + dp[i - 1][k - j]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][target];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRollsToTarget(int n, int faces, int target) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(target + 1));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= faces; j++) {
                for (int k = j; k <= target; k++) {
                    dp[i][k] = (dp[i][k] + dp[i - 1][k - j]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][target];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numRollsToTarget(self, n: int, faces: int, target: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        dp = [[0] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, faces + 1):
                for k in range(j, target + 1):
                    dp[i][k] = (dp[i][k] + dp[i - 1][k - j]) % MOD
        
        return dp[n][target]
