### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We need to consider two cases: placing a house on a plot and leaving the plot empty. We will maintain two arrays to track the number of ways to place houses on each side of the street without violating the constraint of adjacent houses. The number of ways to place houses on each side will depend on the number of ways to place houses on the previous plots.

1. Initialize two arrays dp1 and dp2 of size n+1 to track the number of ways to place houses on each side of the street.
2. Initialize dp1[1] and dp2[1] as 1, representing placing a house on the first plot on each side.
3. Loop through the plots from the second plot to the nth plot.
4. For each plot i, the number of ways to place a house on that plot is the sum of two scenarios: placing a house on the current plot and leaving the previous plot empty.
5. Update dp1[i] and dp2[i] based on the above scenarios.
6. Finally, return the total number of ways to place houses on both sides.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(int n) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        long[] dp1 = new long[n + 1];
        long[] dp2 = new long[n + 1];
        dp1[1] = 1;
        dp2[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp1[i] = (dp1[i - 1] + dp2[i - 1]) % MOD;
            dp2[i] = dp1[i - 1];
        }
        
        long total = (dp1[n] + dp2[n]) % MOD;
        return (int)total;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        vector<long> dp1(n + 1, 0);
        vector<long> dp2(n + 1, 0);
        dp1[1] = 1;
        dp2[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp1[i] = (dp1[i - 1] + dp2[i - 1]) % MOD;
            dp2[i] = dp1[i - 1];
        }
        
        long total = (dp1[n] + dp2[n]) % MOD;
        return static_cast<int>(total);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        dp1 = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp2 = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp1[1] = 1
        dp2[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp1[i] = (dp1[i - 1] + dp2[i - 1]) % MOD
            dp2[i] = dp1[i - 1]
            
        total = (dp1[n] + dp2[n]) % MOD
        return int(total)
