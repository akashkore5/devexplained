## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach along with some dynamic programming. The idea is to consider each edge in the tree as a potential cut. We can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each node as the root of the tree, and for each edge, we can recursively calculate the minimum score after removals. 

For each edge, we can calculate the XOR values of the three components created by removing that edge. Then we can find the minimum score by comparing the score for each edge. We need to remember the XOR values of each component for each node to avoid recalculating them.

### Algorithm steps:
1. Implement a DFS function to traverse the tree and calculate the XOR values for each node and its subtree.
2. For each edge, remove it and calculate the XOR values of the three components.
3. Recursively find the minimum score for each possible cut in the tree.
4. Return the minimum score found.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) to store the XOR values for each node.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minScoreTriangulation(int[] nums, int[][] edges) {
        // Java solution code here
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int[] minScoreTriangulation(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // C++ solution code here
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, nums: List[int], edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Python solution code here
