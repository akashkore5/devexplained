## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the products that were never sold.

We can achieve this by using a SQL query that selects the products from the `Sales` table that do not have corresponding entries in the `Products` table. We can use a left join to accomplish this.

:
:
```java
SELECT Products.product_id, product_name 
FROM Products 
LEFT JOIN Sales 
ON Products.product_id = Sales.product_id 
WHERE Sales.product_id IS NULL;
```

### C++:
```cpp
SELECT Products.product_id, product_name 
FROM Products 
LEFT JOIN Sales 
ON Products.product_id = Sales.product_id 
WHERE Sales.product_id IS NULL;
```

### Python:
```python
SELECT Products.product_id, product_name 
FROM Products 
LEFT JOIN Sales 
ON Products.product_id = Sales.product_id 
WHERE Sales.product_id IS NULL;
```
