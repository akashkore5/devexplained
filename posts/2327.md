### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process day by day. We can maintain a set of people who know the secret on each day. On each day, we iterate through the set of people who know the secret and update it based on the rules given in the problem description. We also keep track of the total number of people who know the secret at the end of each day.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a set `known` with one person who knows the secret on day 1.
2. Iterate from day 2 to day n:
   - Create a new set `new_known` to store people who will know the secret on the current day.
   - For each person in the `known` set:
     - If the person has not forgotten the secret, add them to the `new_known` set.
     - If the person can share the secret on the current day, add a new person to the `new_known` set.
   - Update `known` set to be equal to `new_known`.
   - Update the total number of people who know the secret.
3. Return the total number of people who know the secret modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the given integer representing the number of days.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n) as we are storing a set of people who know the secret on each day.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        Set<Integer> known = new HashSet<>();
        known.add(1);
        
        for (int day = 2; day <= n; day++) {
            Set<Integer> newKnown = new HashSet<>();
            for (int person : known) {
                if (day - person <= forget) {
                    newKnown.add(person);
                }
                if (day - person >= delay && day - person <= forget) {
                    newKnown.add(day);
                }
            }
            known = newKnown;
        }
        
        return known.size() % MOD;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int findSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        std::unordered_set<int> known;
        known.insert(1);

        for (int day = 2; day <= n; day++) {
            std::unordered_set<int> newKnown;
            for (int person : known) {
                if (day - person <= forget) {
                    newKnown.insert(person);
                }
                if (day - person >= delay && day - person <= forget) {
                    newKnown.insert(day);
                }
            }
            known = newKnown;
        }

        return known.size() % MOD;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findSecret(self, n: int, delay: int, forget: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        known = {1}

        for day in range(2, n+1):
            new_known = set()
            for person in known:
                if day - person <= forget:
                    new_known.add(person)
                if delay <= day - person <= forget:
                    new_known.add(day)
            known = new_known

        return len(known) % MOD
