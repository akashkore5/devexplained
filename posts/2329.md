## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to write a SQL query to find the names of the customers who have never bought any product. We can achieve this by using the `LEFT JOIN` clause to combine the `Customers` table with the `Orders` table. By selecting the customers whose `customer_id` does not appear in the `Orders` table, we can identify the customers who have never made a purchase.
### SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT Customers.name AS customer_name
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id
WHERE Orders.customer_id IS NULL
```
