## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to minimize the time it takes to fill all the cups. We can observe that filling up 2 cups with different types of water (2 seconds) is more efficient than filling up 1 cup of any type of water (1 second). Therefore, we should prioritize filling up 2 cups with different types of water whenever possible. 

The algorithmic idea is to keep filling up 2 cups with different types of water until one type of cup runs out, then switch to filling up 1 cup at a time until all cups are filled. We will keep track of the remaining cups and the current time taken. 

At each step, we will check which type of cup has the most remaining cups, and fill up 2 cups with different types of water if possible. If not, we fill up 1 cup of any type. We continue this process until all cups are filled.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSecondsToFillCups(int[] amount) {
        int totalSeconds = 0;
        while (amount[0] > 0 && amount[1] > 0 && amount[2] > 0) {
            amount[0]--;
            amount[1]--;
            amount[2]--;
            totalSeconds += 2;
        }
        while (amount[0] > 0 || amount[1] > 0 || amount[2] > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                if (amount[i] > 0) {
                    amount[i]--;
                    totalSeconds++;
                }
            }
        }
        return totalSeconds;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSecondsToFillCups(vector<int>& amount) {
        int totalSeconds = 0;
        while (amount[0] > 0 && amount[1] > 0 && amount[2] > 0) {
            amount[0]--;
            amount[1]--;
            amount[2]--;
            totalSeconds += 2;
        }
        while (amount[0] > 0 || amount[1] > 0 || amount[2] > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                if (amount[i] > 0) {
                    amount[i]--;
                    totalSeconds++;
                }
            }
        }
        return totalSeconds;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minSecondsToFillCups(self, amount: List[int]) -> int:
        total_seconds = 0
        while amount[0] > 0 and amount[1] > 0 and amount[2] > 0:
            amount[0] -= 1
            amount[1] -= 1
            amount[2] -= 1
            total_seconds += 2
        while any(amount):
            for i in range(3):
                if amount[i] > 0:
                    amount[i] -= 1
                    total_seconds += 1
        return total_seconds
```
