### Explanation

To generate all the matches of a league with **n** teams, we can simulate a round-robin tournament where each team plays against every other team exactly once. We iterate through all pairs of teams and generate a match for each pair. The total number of matches will be **n * (n-1) / 2**.

```java
public List<String> allMatchesOfTheLeague(int n) {
    List<String> matches = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            matches.add(i + " vs " + j);
        }
    }
    return matches;
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
vector<string> allMatchesOfTheLeague(int n) {
    vector<string> matches;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            matches.push_back(to_string(i) + " vs " + to_string(j));
        }
    }
    return matches;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def allMatchesOfTheLeague(n):
    matches = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            matches.append(str(i) + " vs " + str(j))
    return matches
```
