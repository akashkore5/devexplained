### Explanation
To check if a linked list is a palindrome, we can follow these steps:
1. Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Compare the first half with the reversed second half to determine if it is a palindrome.

Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        
        // Find the middle of the linked list
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        // Reverse the second half of the linked list
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = slow;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        
        // Compare the first half with the reversed second half
        ListNode firstHalf = head;
        ListNode secondHalf = prev;
        while (secondHalf != null) {
            if (firstHalf.val != secondHalf.val) {
                return false;
            }
            firstHalf = firstHalf.next;
            secondHalf = secondHalf.next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        
        // Find the middle of the linked list
        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        
        // Reverse the second half of the linked list
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = slow;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        
        // Compare the first half with the reversed second half
        ListNode* firstHalf = head;
        ListNode* secondHalf = prev;
        while (secondHalf != nullptr) {
            if (firstHalf->val != secondHalf->val) {
                return false;
            }
            firstHalf = firstHalf->next;
            secondHalf = secondHalf->next;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        slow = fast = head
        
        # Find the middle of the linked list
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Reverse the second half of the linked list
        prev = None
        curr = slow
        while curr:
            nextTemp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nextTemp
        
        # Compare the first half with the reversed second half
        first_half = head
        second_half = prev
        while second_half:
            if first_half.val != second_half.val:
                return False
            first_half = first_half.next
            second_half = second_half.next
