## Explanation

To find the number of visible mountains, we can iterate through the array of mountain heights from left to right. We will keep track of the maximum height seen so far. If the current mountain height is greater than the maximum height seen so far, we increment the count of visible mountains and update the maximum height seen. At the end of the iteration, the count of visible mountains will be the answer.

Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate through the array once.
Space complexity: O(1) - We use constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int visibleMountains(int[] heights) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxSeen = 0;
        
        for (int height : heights) {
            if (height > maxSeen) {
                count++;
                maxSeen = height;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int visibleMountains(vector<int>& heights) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxSeen = 0;
        
        for (int height : heights) {
            if (height > maxSeen) {
                count++;
                maxSeen = height;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def visibleMountains(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        max_seen = 0
        
        for height in heights:
            if height > max_seen:
                count += 1
                max_seen = height
        
        return count
```
