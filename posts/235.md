### Explanation

To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary search tree (BST), we can utilize the properties of a BST. The key idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root and search for a node `p` and a node `q` such that their values lie within the range of the current node's value. This way, we can determine the LCA by following the path where the values of `p` and `q` diverge.

1. Start from the root node.
2. If both `p` and `q` are greater than the current node's value, move to the right subtree.
3. If both `p` and `q` are smaller than the current node's value, move to the left subtree.
4. If the current node's value lies between `p` and `q`, then the current node is the LCA.
5. Return the LCA node.

The time complexity for this approach is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of a BST can be O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, making the time complexity O(n). The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space for the algorithm.
```java
public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    while (root != null) {
        if (p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
            root = root.left;
        } else if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
            root = root.right;
        } else {
            return root;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

```cpp
TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
    while (root != NULL) {
        if (p->val < root->val && q->val < root->val) {
            root = root->left;
        } else if (p->val > root->val && q->val > root->val) {
            root = root->right;
        } else {
            return root;
        }
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q):
    while root:
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            root = root.left
        elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            root = root.right
        else:
            return root
    return None
```
