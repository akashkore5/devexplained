## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of books we can take at each position. At each position, we can either choose to take the current book or skip it. If we take the book, we need to consider the maximum number of books we can take at the previous position. If we skip the book, we can take the maximum number of books we could have taken at the previous position. We then populate the 2D array accordingly until we reach the end of the array. Finally, the maximum number of books we can take will be the value at the last position in the 2D array.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `n x 2`, where `n` is the number of books.
2. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 (if we take the first book) and `dp[0][1]` to 0 (if we skip the first book).
3. Iterate through the books starting from the second book.
4. For each book at index `i`, update `dp[i][0]` to be the maximum of:
   - `dp[i-1][1] + 1` (if we take the current book)
   - `dp[i-1][0]` (if we skip the current book)
5. Update `dp[i][1]` to be the maximum of:
   - `dp[i-1][1]` (if we skip the current book)
   - `dp[i-1][0]` (if we take the current book)
6. The maximum number of books we can take will be the maximum of `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-1][1]`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of books.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) for the 2D array `dp`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxBooks(int[] books) {
        int n = books.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][2];
        
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][1] + 1, dp[i-1][0]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0]);
        }
        
        return Math.max(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1]);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxBooks(vector<int>& books) {
        int n = books.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2, 0));
        
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][1] + 1, dp[i-1][0]);
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0]);
        }
        
        return max(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1]);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxBooks(self, books: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(books)
        dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n)]
        
        dp[0][0] = 1
        dp[0][1] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][1] + 1, dp[i-1][0])
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0])
        
        return max(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1])
```
