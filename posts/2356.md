### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches. We can achieve this by grouping the data by teacher_id and then counting the distinct subject_ids for each teacher.

1. Group the data by teacher_id.
2. Count the number of unique subject_ids for each teacher.
3. Return the result table with teacher_id and the count of unique subjects they teach.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of rows in the Teacher table.
**Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the result.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```
