## Explanation:
To find the longest cycle in a directed graph, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each node to detect cycles. We maintain a visited set to keep track of nodes visited in the current DFS traversal. If we encounter a node that has already been visited in the current traversal, we have found a cycle. We keep track of the length of the cycle and return the maximum length found.

## Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `maxCycleLength` to store the maximum cycle length found.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph and perform a DFS from that node.
3. In the DFS function:
   - Keep track of the current path length and visited nodes.
   - If we encounter a node that is already visited in the current traversal, calculate the cycle length and update `maxCycleLength`.
4. Return `maxCycleLength` if a cycle is found, otherwise return -1.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack and the visited set.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCycleInGraph(int[] edges) {
        int maxCycleLength = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
            int cycleLength = dfs(i, i, 0, new boolean[edges.length], edges);
            maxCycleLength = Math.max(maxCycleLength, cycleLength);
        }
        return maxCycleLength;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int start, int current, int pathLength, boolean[] visited, int[] edges) {
        if (visited[current]) {
            if (current == start && pathLength > 1) {
                return pathLength;
            }
            return -1;
        }
        visited[current] = true;
        int next = edges[current];
        if (next == -1) {
            visited[current] = false;
            return -1;
        }
        int cycleLength = dfs(start, next, pathLength + 1, visited, edges);
        visited[current] = false;
        return cycleLength;
    }
