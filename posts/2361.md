## Explanation:
The problem asks us to find the minimum cost to get from the start station to the end station using the train line. We are given the costs of traveling between adjacent stations in both directions and the cost of skipping a station. The solution involves dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost at each station while considering whether to skip the current station or not.

1. We maintain two arrays to store the minimum cost of reaching each station. One array represents the minimum cost when we don't skip the current station, and the other represents the minimum cost when we skip the current station.
2. We start by initializing the costs for the start station. The cost of reaching the start station without skipping is 0, and the cost of skipping it is the skip cost.
3. We iterate through the stations from the second one to the end, updating the minimum costs for each station based on the previous stations.
4. At each station, we calculate the minimum cost of reaching it without skipping by taking the minimum of the previous station's cost without skipping and the cost of going from the previous station to the current station. We also calculate the minimum cost of reaching it by skipping by taking the minimum of the previous station's cost without skipping and the previous station's cost with skipping.
5. Finally, the minimum cost to reach the end station is the minimum of the cost of reaching the end station without skipping and the cost of skipping the end station.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] costs, int skipCost) {
        int n = costs.length;
        int[] dpNoSkip = new int[n];
        int[] dpSkip = new int[n];
        
        dpNoSkip[0] = 0;
        dpSkip[0] = skipCost;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dpNoSkip[i] = Math.min(dpNoSkip[i - 1] + costs[i - 1], dpSkip[i - 1]);
            dpSkip[i] = Math.min(dpNoSkip[i - 1], dpSkip[i - 1] + skipCost);
        }
        
        return Math.min(dpNoSkip[n - 1] + costs[n - 1], dpSkip[n - 1]);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(std::vector<int>& costs, int skipCost) {
        int n = costs.size();
        std::vector<int> dpNoSkip(n);
        std::vector<int> dpSkip(n);
        
        dpNoSkip[0] = 0;
        dpSkip[0] = skipCost;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dpNoSkip[i] = std::min(dpNoSkip[i - 1] + costs[i - 1], dpSkip[i - 1]);
            dpSkip[i] = std::min(dpNoSkip[i - 1], dpSkip[i - 1] + skipCost);
        }
        
        return std::min(dpNoSkip[n - 1] + costs[n - 1], dpSkip[n - 1]);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[int], skipCost: int) -> int:
        n = len(costs)
        dp_no_skip = [0] * n
        dp_skip = [0] * n
        
        dp_no_skip[0] = 0
        dp_skip[0] = skipCost
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp_no_skip[i] = min(dp_no_skip[i - 1] + costs[i - 1], dp_skip[i - 1])
            dp_skip[i] = min(dp_no_skip[i - 1], dp_skip[i - 1] + skipCost)
        
        return min(dp_no_skip[n - 1] + costs[n - 1], dp_skip[n - 1])
