### Explanation:

To generate the invoice, we need to calculate the total amount of each product purchased by a customer. The input data contains a list of products with their corresponding prices and quantities. We need to create an invoice for each product showing the total amount to be paid by the customer.

1. Create a hashmap to store the total amount for each product.
2. Iterate through the list of products and update the total amount in the hashmap.
3. Generate the invoice for each product using the product name, price, quantity, and total amount.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of products in the input list.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) to store the total amount for each product.

:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class InvoiceGenerator {
    public Map<String, Double> generateInvoice(List<String> products, List<Double> prices, List<Integer> quantities) {
        Map<String, Double> invoices = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < products.size(); i++) {
            String product = products.get(i);
            double price = prices.get(i);
            int quantity = quantities.get(i);
            
            double totalAmount = price * quantity;
            invoices.put(product, totalAmount);
        }
        
        return invoices;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<string, double> generateInvoice(vector<string>& products, vector<double>& prices, vector<int>& quantities) {
    unordered_map<string, double> invoices;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < products.size(); i++) {
        string product = products[i];
        double price = prices[i];
        int quantity = quantities[i];
        
        double totalAmount = price * quantity;
        invoices[product] = totalAmount;
    }
    
    return invoices;
}
```

```python
def generate_invoice(products, prices, quantities):
    invoices = {}
    
    for i in range(len(products)):
        product = products[i]
        price = prices[i]
        quantity = quantities[i]
        
        total_amount = price * quantity
        invoices[product] = total_amount
    
    return invoices
```
