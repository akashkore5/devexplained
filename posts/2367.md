### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to keep track of the count of potential triplets as we iterate through the array. For each element `num` in the array, we check if `num - diff` exists in the map (i.e., a potential `j`) and `num - 2*diff` exists in the map (i.e., a potential `i`). If both exist, we increment the count of triplets by the value at `num - diff`. This is because we have found a valid triplet (i, j, k) where `j` is the current element, `i` is `num - diff`, and `k` is `num`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(N) due to the hashmap storing potential triplets.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums, int diff) {
        int count = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int prevCount = map.getOrDefault(num - diff, 0);
            count += prevCount;
            
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + prevCount);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums, int diff) {
        int count = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int prevCount = map.count(num - diff) ? map[num - diff] : 0;
            count += prevCount;
            
            map[num] += prevCount;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, nums: List[int], diff: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        map = {}
        
        for num in nums:
            prev_count = map.get(num - diff, 0)
            count += prev_count
            
            map[num] = map.get(num, 0) + prev_count
        
        return count
```
