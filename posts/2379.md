### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window of size k and slide it through the array to find the minimum number of recolor operations needed to get k consecutive black blocks. We will count the number of white blocks inside the window and keep track of the minimum count needed to achieve k consecutive black blocks. 

### Algorithm
1. Initialize variables: `minOps` to store the minimum operations needed, `count` to count white blocks in the window, and `minCount` to store the minimum count needed for k consecutive black blocks.
2. Iterate through the blocks array from 0 to n-k.
3. For each window of size k, count the number of white blocks inside the window.
4. Update `minCount` with the minimum of current `minCount` and `(k - count)` (operations needed to convert white blocks to black blocks).
5. Update `minOps` with the minimum of current `minOps` and `minCount`.
6. Return `minOps` as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `blocks`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minRecolors(String blocks, int k) {
        int n = blocks.length();
        int minOps = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
                if (blocks.charAt(j) == 'W') {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            int minCount = Math.min(minOps, k - count);
            minOps = Math.min(minOps, minCount);
        }
        
        return minOps == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minOps;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minRecolors(string blocks, int k) {
        int n = blocks.size();
        int minOps = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
                if (blocks[j] == 'W') {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            int minCount = min(minOps, k - count);
            minOps = min(minOps, minCount);
        }
        
        return minOps == INT_MAX ? 0 : minOps;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minRecolors(self, blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(blocks)
        minOps = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            count = 0
            for j in range(i, i + k):
                if blocks[j] == 'W':
                    count += 1
            minCount = min(minOps, k - count)
            minOps = min(minOps, minCount)
        
        return minOps if minOps != float('inf') else 0
