### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of replacing "01" with "10" in the binary string until no more occurrences exist. We can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of seconds needed to complete the process.

- Iterate through the string and whenever we find "01", replace it with "10".
- Repeat this process until no more occurrences of "01" exist.
- Count the number of iterations needed, which represents the number of seconds required to rearrange the binary string.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input binary string.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int rearrangeBinaryString(String s) {
        int seconds = 0;
        while (s.contains("01")) {
            s = s.replace("01", "10");
            seconds++;
        }
        return seconds;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rearrangeBinaryString(string s) {
        int seconds = 0;
        while (s.find("01") != string::npos) {
            size_t pos = s.find("01");
            s.replace(pos, 2, "10");
            seconds++;
        }
        return seconds;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def rearrangeBinaryString(self, s: str) -> int:
        seconds = 0
        while "01" in s:
            s = s.replace("01", "10")
            seconds += 1
        return seconds
```
