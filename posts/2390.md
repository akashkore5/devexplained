## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string from left to right. Whenever we encounter a star, we remove the closest non-star character to its left and the star itself. We repeat this process until there are no more stars left in the string. 

- We can use a stack to keep track of non-star characters encountered so far.
- When we encounter a star, we pop the top element from the stack because it is the closest non-star character to the left of the star.
- After iterating through the whole string, we reconstruct the final string using the elements left in the stack.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is also O(n) due to the stack used.
```java
public String removeStars(String s) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '*') {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }
    
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        sb.insert(0, stack.pop());
    }
    
    return sb.toString();
}
```

### C++
```cpp
string removeStars(string s) {
    stack<char> st;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '*') {
            st.pop();
        } else {
            st.push(c);
        }
    }
    
    string result = "";
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result = st.top() + result;
        st.pop();
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Python
```python
def removeStars(s):
    stack = []
    
    for c in s:
        if c == '*':
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(c)
    
    result = ""
    while stack:
        result = stack.pop() + result
        
    return result
```
