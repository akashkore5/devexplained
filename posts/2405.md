### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through each character in the string and maintain a set to keep track of unique characters we have encountered so far in the current substring. Whenever we encounter a character that is already in the set, it means we need to start a new substring from that character.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty set to store unique characters.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of substrings.
3. Iterate through each character in the string.
4. If the character is not in the set, add it to the set.
5. If the character is already in the set, increment `count` and clear the set.
6. Return the final value of `count`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(26) = O(1) since we are using a set to store unique characters.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPartitions(String s) {
        Set<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!uniqueChars.contains(c)) {
                uniqueChars.add(c);
            } else {
                count++;
                uniqueChars.clear();
                uniqueChars.add(c);
            }
        }
        
        return count + 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(string s) {
        unordered_set<char> uniqueChars;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (uniqueChars.find(c) == uniqueChars.end()) {
                uniqueChars.insert(c);
            } else {
                count++;
                uniqueChars.clear();
                uniqueChars.insert(c);
            }
        }
        
        return count + 1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minPartitions(self, s: str) -> int:
        unique_chars = set()
        count = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if c not in unique_chars:
                unique_chars.add(c)
            else:
                count += 1
                unique_chars.clear()
                unique_chars.add(c)
        
        return count + 1
```
