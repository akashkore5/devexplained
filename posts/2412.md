### Explanation:
To find the minimum amount of money required before any transaction so that all transactions can be completed regardless of the order, we can use a greedy approach. We need to consider the transactions with the highest cost first, as these will require the most money to complete.

1. Sort the transactions array in descending order based on the difference between cost and cashback.
2. Initialize a variable `money` to keep track of the total money required.
3. Iterate through the sorted transactions array and update the `money` variable accordingly.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minMoneyRequired(int[][] transactions) {
        Arrays.sort(transactions, (a, b) -> (b[0] - b[1]) - (a[0] - a[1]));
        int money = 0;
        for (int[] transaction : transactions) {
            money = Math.max(money, transaction[0]) + transaction[1];
        }
        return money;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minMoneyRequired(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& transactions) {
        std::sort(transactions.begin(), transactions.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return (b[0] - b[1]) > (a[0] - a[1]);
        });
        int money = 0;
        for (const auto& transaction : transactions) {
            money = std::max(money, transaction[0]) + transaction[1];
        }
        return money;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minMoneyRequired(self, transactions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        transactions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] - x[0]), reverse=True)
        money = 0
        for transaction in transactions:
            money = max(money, transaction[0]) + transaction[1]
        return money
```
