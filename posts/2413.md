### Explanation:
To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 2 and n, we can simply multiply n by 2 if n is already even, or multiply n by 2 until it becomes even. This is because any multiple of n will also be a multiple of 2 if n is even.

- Initialize a variable `result` to n.
- If n is odd, multiply n by 2 until it becomes even.
- Return the result.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) because we might need to multiply n by 2 multiple times to make it even.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        int result = n;
        while (result % 2 != 0) {
            result *= 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        int result = n;
        while (result % 2 != 0) {
            result *= 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestEvenMultiple(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = n
        while result % 2 != 0:
            result *= 2
        return result
```
