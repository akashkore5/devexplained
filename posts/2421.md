### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the tree starting from each node. While traversing, we keep track of the count of good paths starting from the current node. We also maintain a dictionary to store the count of values encountered on the path from the current node to the root node.

At each node, we iterate over its neighbors and recursively call the DFS function for each neighbor while updating the count of good paths and the dictionary storing values encountered on the path.

The count of good paths from a node to its parent can be calculated based on the values encountered on the path. We increment the count by the number of good paths starting from the current node and add the count of paths that can be formed by connecting the current node to its ancestors with the same value.

Finally, we sum up the counts of good paths starting from each node to get the total number of distinct good paths in the tree.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the recursion stack and dictionary storing values encountered on the path.

```java
class Solution {
    int count = 0;

    public int countGoodPaths(int[] vals, int[][] edges) {
        Map<Integer, Integer>[] paths = new HashMap[vals.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < vals.length; i++) {
            paths[i] = new HashMap<>();
        }

        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < vals.length; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        dfs(0, -1, vals, paths, graph);

        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(int node, int parent, int[] vals, Map<Integer, Integer>[] paths, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> path = new HashMap<>();
        path.put(vals[node], 1);

        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            dfs(neighbor, node, vals, paths, graph);

            for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : paths[neighbor].entrySet()) {
                int key = entry.getKey();
                int value = entry.getValue();
                int newPathCount = path.getOrDefault(key, 0) + value;
                path.put(key, newPathCount);
                if (key == vals[node]) {
                    count += value;
                }
            }
        }

        paths[node] = path;
    }

            graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        dfs(0, -1, vals, paths, graph, count);

        return count;
    }

    void dfs(int node, int parent, vector<int>& vals, vector<unordered_map<int, int>>& paths, vector<vector<int>>& graph, int& count) {
        unordered_map<int, int> path;
        path[vals[node]] = 1;

        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            dfs(neighbor, node, vals, paths, graph, count);

            for (auto& entry : paths[neighbor]) {
                int key = entry.first;
                int value = entry.second;
                int newPathCount = path[key] + value;
                path[key] = newPathCount;
                if (key == vals[node]) {
                    count += value;
