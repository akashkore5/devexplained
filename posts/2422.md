## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We start by comparing elements from both ends of the array. If the elements at both ends are equal, we move the pointers towards the center. If the elements are not equal, we need to perform a merge operation to make them equal. We keep track of the number of merge operations needed to turn the array into a palindrome.

Here are the steps for the algorithm:
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` pointing to the start of the array, and `right` pointing to the end of the array.
2. While `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer:
   - If `arr[left] == arr[right]`, increment `left` and decrement `right`.
   - If `arr[left] < arr[right]`, merge `arr[left]` with `arr[left+1]` by incrementing `left` and increment the merge operations count.
   - If `arr[left] > arr[right]`, merge `arr[right]` with `arr[right-1]` by decrementing `right` and increment the merge operations count.
3. Return the total number of merge operations.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMergeOperations(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
        int merges = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            if (arr[left] == arr[right]) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (arr[left] < arr[right]) {
                arr[left + 1] += arr[left];
                left++;
                merges++;
            } else {
                arr[right - 1] += arr[right];
                right--;
                merges++;
            }
        }
        
        return merges;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMergeOperations(vector<int>& arr) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
        int merges = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            if (arr[left] == arr[right]) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (arr[left] < arr[right]) {
                arr[left + 1] += arr[left];
                left++;
                merges++;
            } else {
                arr[right - 1] += arr[right];
                right--;
                merges++;
            }
        }
        
        return merges;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minMergeOperations(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        merges = 0
        
        while left <= right:
            if arr[left] == arr[right]:
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif arr[left] < arr[right]:
                arr[left + 1] += arr[left]
                left += 1
                merges += 1
            else:
                arr[right - 1] += arr[right]
                right -= 1
                merges += 1
        
        return merges
```
