## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of the uploaded videos. We can also keep a variable `longestPrefix` to store the length of the longest uploaded prefix. When a new video is uploaded, we add it to the set and check if the current uploaded sequence is the longest prefix so far. We do this by iterating from 1 to the maximum video number and checking if all videos in that range have been uploaded.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a set to store uploaded videos and a variable `longestPrefix` to 0.
2. In the constructor `LUPrefix(int n)`, initialize the set and set `longestPrefix` to 0.
3. In the `upload(int video)` method, add the uploaded video to the set.
4. Update `longestPrefix` by iterating from 1 to the maximum video number and checking if all videos in that range have been uploaded.
5. Return `longestPrefix` in the `longest()` method.

### Time Complexity:
- The `upload` and `longest` operations both take O(n) time, where n is the number of videos.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) to store the uploaded videos.
```java
class LUPrefix {
    Set<Integer> uploadedVideos;
    int longestPrefix;

    public LUPrefix(int n) {
        uploadedVideos = new HashSet<>();
        longestPrefix = 0;
    }

    public void upload(int video) {
        uploadedVideos.add(video);
        for (int i = 1; uploadedVideos.contains(i); i++) {
            longestPrefix = i;
        }
    }

    public int longest() {
        return longestPrefix;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class LUPrefix {
public:
    unordered_set<int> uploadedVideos;
    int longestPrefix;

    LUPrefix(int n) {
        longestPrefix = 0;
    }

    void upload(int video) {
        uploadedVideos.insert(video);
        for (int i = 1; uploadedVideos.count(i); i++) {
            longestPrefix = i;
        }
    }

    int longest() {
        return longestPrefix;
    }
};
```

```python
class LUPrefix:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.uploaded_videos = set()
        self.longest_prefix = 0

    def upload(self, video: int) -> None:
        self.uploaded_videos.add(video)
        for i in range(1, video + 1):
            if i not in self.uploaded_videos:
                break
            self.longest_prefix = i

    def longest(self) -> int:
        return self.longest_prefix
```
