## Explanation
To find the number of common factors of two positive integers, we can iterate from 1 to the minimum of the two integers and check if the current number is a common factor of both. If it is, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter as the result. 

- Start with a counter variable `count` set to 0.
- Iterate from 1 to the minimum of `a` and `b` (inclusive).
- For each number `i`, check if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `i`.
- If they are, increment `count`.
- Return `count`.

Time complexity: O(min(a, b))  
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int numCommonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.min(a, b); i++) {
            if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numCommonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= min(a, b); i++) {
            if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numCommonFactors(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
            if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
```
