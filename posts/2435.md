### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming. We will maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of paths from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)` whose sum of elements is divisible by `k`.

We can fill up the `dp` array by iterating row by row and column by column. For each cell `(i,j)` in the grid, the number of paths to reach that cell is the sum of paths coming from the cell above `(i-1, j)` and the cell on the left `(i, j-1)`.

To calculate the sum of elements along the path, we need to consider the current element in the grid as well. If the sum of elements along the path to `(i,j)` is divisible by `k`, we increment the count in `dp[i][j]`.

Finally, the result will be stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the input matrix.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is also O(m*n) for the `dp` array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPaths(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        dp[0][0] = (grid[0][0] % k == 0) ? 1 : 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]) % k == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j]) % k == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % k == 0 ? 1 : 0;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        dp[0][0] = (grid[0][0] % k == 0) ? 1 : 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]) % k == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = (dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j]) % k == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % k == 0 ? 1 : 0;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = 1 if grid[0][0] % k == 0 else 0
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = 1 if (dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]) % k == 0 else 0
        
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[0][j] = 1 if (dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j]) % k == 0 else 0
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = 1 if (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % k == 0 else 0
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
