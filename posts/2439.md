## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of the maximum integer in the array `nums` after performing a series of operations where we decrease an element at index `i` by 1 and increase the element at index `i-1` by 1. The key insight is that the maximum integer in the array will decrease by at least 1 in each operation.

Therefore, to minimize the maximum integer, we need to distribute the excess values from larger elements to smaller elements in an optimal way. We can achieve this by iterating through the array and performing operations whenever we encounter a value that is greater than the value on its left.

The algorithm involves iterating through the array and performing the operations as described above until we reach a point where no more operations can be performed. The minimum possible value of the maximum integer will be the maximum value in the array at that point.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizeMax(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                int diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
                max = Math.max(max, nums[i]);
                nums[i] -= diff;
                nums[i - 1] += diff;
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizeMax(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                int diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
                max = max(max, nums[i]);
                nums[i] -= diff;
                nums[i - 1] += diff;
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeMax(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_val = nums[0]
        n = len(nums)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
                max_val = max(max_val, nums[i])
                nums[i] -= diff
                nums[i - 1] += diff
        
        return max_val
```
