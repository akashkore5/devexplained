## Explanation:

This problem requires us to design a class `WordDistance` that will be initialized with a list of words. The class should have a method `shortest` that will return the shortest distance between two given words in the list of words.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can pre-process the list of words and store their indices in a hashmap. Then, for each pair of words, we can find their respective indices from the hashmap and calculate the minimum distance between them.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap to store the indices of each word in the list.
2. Initialize the hashmap by iterating through the list of words and storing their indices.
3. In the `shortest` method, obtain the indices of the two words from the hashmap.
4. Use two pointers to iterate through the two lists of indices and calculate the minimum distance.

### Time Complexity:
- Preprocessing: O(n) where n is the number of words in the list.
- Shortest method: O(m + n) where m is the number of occurrences of the first word and n is the number of occurrences of the second word.

### Space Complexity:
- O(n) where n is the number of words in the list.

```java
class WordDistance {
    Map<String, List<Integer>> wordIndices;

    public WordDistance(String[] words) {
        wordIndices = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            wordIndices.computeIfAbsent(words[i], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }
    }

    public int shortest(String word1, String word2) {
        List<Integer> indices1 = wordIndices.get(word1);
        List<Integer> indices2 = wordIndices.get(word2);

        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < indices1.size() && j < indices2.size()) {
            minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, Math.abs(indices1.get(i) - indices2.get(j)));
            if (indices1.get(i) < indices2.get(j)) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        return minDistance;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class WordDistance {
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<int>> wordIndices;

public:
    WordDistance(vector<string>& words) {
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            wordIndices[words[i]].push_back(i);
        }
    }

    int shortest(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> indices1 = wordIndices[word1];
        vector<int> indices2 = wordIndices[word2];

        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < indices1.size() && j < indices2.size()) {
            minDistance = min(minDistance, abs(indices1[i] - indices2[j]));
            if (indices1[i] < indices2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        return minDistance;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class WordDistance:

    def __init__(self, words: List[str]):
        self.word_indices = {}
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            self.word_indices[word] = self.word_indices.get(word, []) + [i]

    def shortest(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        indices1 = self.word_indices[word1]
        indices2 = self.word_indices[word2]

        min_distance = float('inf')
        i, j = 0, 0

        while i < len(indices1) and j < len(indices2):
            min_distance = min(min_distance, abs(indices1[i] - indices2[j]))
            if indices1[i] < indices2[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

        return min_distance
