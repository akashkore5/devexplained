## Explanation
To determine if two events have a conflict, we need to check if there is any overlap between the time intervals of the two events. We can do this by comparing the end time of the first event with the start time of the second event, and vice versa. If there is any overlap, then there is a conflict.

### Algorithm
1. Parse the input strings to extract the start and end times of both events.
2. Check if the end time of the first event is greater than or equal to the start time of the second event, and vice versa.
3. If either condition is true, there is a conflict. Return true.
4. If both conditions are false, there is no conflict. Return false.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since we are performing a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isEventConflict(String[] event1, String[] event2) {
        String startTime1 = event1[0];
        String endTime1 = event1[1];
        String startTime2 = event2[0];
        String endTime2 = event2[1];

        return (endTime1.compareTo(startTime2) >= 0) && (endTime2.compareTo(startTime1) >= 0);
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isEventConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
        string startTime1 = event1[0];
        string endTime1 = event1[1];
        string startTime2 = event2[0];
        string endTime2 = event2[1];

        return (endTime1.compare(startTime2) >= 0) && (endTime2.compare(startTime1) >= 0);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def is_event_conflict(self, event1: List[str], event2: List[str]) -> bool:
        startTime1, endTime1 = event1
        startTime2, endTime2 = event2

        return endTime1 >= startTime2 and endTime2 >= startTime1
```
