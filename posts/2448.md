### Explanation
To minimize the total cost while making all elements of the array equal, we need to find the target value to which all elements will converge. This target value can be found by calculating the median of the array. Once we have the target value, we iterate through each element in the array and calculate the cost of moving that element to the target value. The total cost will be the sum of these individual costs.

### Algorithm
1. Calculate the median of the array.
2. Iterate through each element in the array:
   - Calculate the cost of moving the element to the median (abs(target - element) * cost[i]).
   - Add this cost to the total cost.
3. Return the total cost as the minimum cost to make the array equal.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] nums, int[] cost) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long totalCost = 0;
        
        // Calculate the median
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int target = nums[n / 2];
        
        // Calculate total cost
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += Math.abs(target - nums[i]) * cost[i];
        }
        
        return (int) totalCost;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long totalCost = 0;
        
        // Calculate the median
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int target = nums[n / 2];
        
        // Calculate total cost
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += abs(target - nums[i]) * cost[i];
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Calculate the median
        nums.sort()
        target = nums[n // 2]
        
        # Calculate total cost
        for i in range(n):
            total_cost += abs(target - nums[i]) * cost[i]
        
        return total_cost
```
