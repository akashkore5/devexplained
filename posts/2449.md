## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the given array `nums` similar to the target array. We can achieve this by calculating the frequency of elements in both arrays and then comparing these frequencies. The idea is to match the frequency of each element in `nums` with the frequency of the same element in the target array.

We can iterate through the arrays and count the occurrences of each element. Then, by comparing the frequencies of the elements in both arrays, we can determine the minimum number of operations required to make the arrays similar.

The steps involved in the algorithm are as follows:
1. Create a map to store the frequency of elements in both arrays.
2. Iterate through both arrays and count the occurrences of each element.
3. Compare the frequencies of elements in both arrays to find the minimum number of operations required.
4. Return the minimum number of operations.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the arrays. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the frequency of elements.
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int[] target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (int num : nums) {
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int num : target) {
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) - 1);
        }

        int minOps = 0;
        for (int count : freq.values()) {
            minOps += Math.abs(count);
        }

        return minOps / 2;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<int>& target) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;

        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        for (int num : target) {
            freq[num]--;
        }

        int minOps = 0;
        for (auto& p : freq) {
            minOps += std::abs(p.second);
        }

        return minOps / 2;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = Counter(nums)
        freq.subtract(Counter(target))

        min_ops = sum(abs(count) for count in freq.values())

        return min_ops // 2
```
