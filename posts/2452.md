## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each word in the `queries` array and compare it with each word in the `dictionary` array. For each pair of words, we check if they are equal or if they can be made equal with at most two edits. We can achieve this by comparing the characters in both words and keeping track of the differences.

1. For each word in `queries`, we iterate through each word in `dictionary`.
2. If the words are equal, or if they can be made equal with at most two edits, we add the word from `queries` to the result list.
3. We return the list of words from `queries` that match with some word from `dictionary` after a maximum of two edits.

Time complexity: O(n * m * k), where n is the number of words in `queries`, m is the number of words in `dictionary`, and k is the length of each word.
Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of words in `queries`.
