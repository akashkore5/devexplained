### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate through the given array `nums` and check if each even number is divisible by 3. If it is, we add it to our running sum and keep track of the count of such numbers. Finally, we return the integer division of the sum by the count. If no even number is found that satisfies the condition, we return 0.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `sum` and `count` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`.
3. Check if `num` is even and divisible by 3.
4. If the condition is satisfied, add `num` to `sum` and increment `count`.
5. After iterating through all elements, return `sum / count` if `count` is greater than 0, else return 0.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int averageEvenDivByThree(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 == 0) {
                sum += num;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count > 0 ? sum / count : 0;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int averageEvenDivByThree(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 == 0) {
                sum += num;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count > 0 ? sum / count : 0;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def averageEvenDivByThree(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total_sum = 0
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num % 2 == 0 and num % 3 == 0:
                total_sum += num
                count += 1
        
        return total_sum // count if count > 0 else 0
