### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the popularity of each creator by summing up the views of all their videos. Then we find the creators with the highest popularity and for each of these creators, we determine their most viewed video based on the given constraints.

1. Create a hashmap to store the total views for each creator.
2. Create a hashmap to store the most viewed video id for each creator.
3. Iterate through the input arrays and populate the above hashmaps.
4. Find the maximum popularity among all creators.
5. Iterate through the creators to find the ones with maximum popularity.
6. For each creator with maximum popularity, find their most viewed video based on the constraints.
7. Return the result in the required format.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> mostPopularVideoCreator(String[] creators, String[] ids, int[] views) {
        Map<String, Integer> popularity = new HashMap<>();
        Map<String, String> mostViewed = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < creators.length; i++) {
            popularity.put(creators[i], popularity.getOrDefault(creators[i], 0) + views[i]);
            if (!mostViewed.containsKey(creators[i]) || views[i] > popularity.get(mostViewed.get(creators[i]))) {
                mostViewed.put(creators[i], ids[i]);
            } else if (views[i] == popularity.get(mostViewed.get(creators[i])) && ids[i].compareTo(mostViewed.get(creators[i])) < 0) {
                mostViewed.put(creators[i], ids[i]);
            }
        }

        int maxPopularity = Collections.max(popularity.values());
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String creator : popularity.keySet()) {
            if (popularity.get(creator) == maxPopularity) {
                result.add(Arrays.asList(creator, mostViewed.get(creator)));
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < creators.size(); i++) {
            popularity[creators[i]] += views[i];
            if (mostViewed.find(creators[i]) == mostViewed.end() || views[i] > popularity[mostViewed[creators[i]]]) {
                mostViewed[creators[i]] = ids[i];
            } else if (views[i] == popularity[mostViewed[creators[i]]] && ids[i] < mostViewed[creators[i]]) {
                mostViewed[creators[i]] = ids[i];
            }
        }

        int maxPopularity = 0;
        for (auto& p : popularity) {
            maxPopularity = max(maxPopularity, p.second);
        }

        vector<vector<string>> result;
        for (auto& p : popularity) {
            if (p.second == maxPopularity) {
                result.push_back({p.first, mostViewed[p.first]});
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
