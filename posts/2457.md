## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum non-negative integer x such that n + x is beautiful. We can do this by calculating the sum of the digits of n and then determining how much we need to add to make the sum less than or equal to the target.

We can find the sum of the digits of a number by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and summing the remainders. Once we have the sum of the digits of n, we can calculate how much we need to add by subtracting the target from the sum. If the sum is already less than or equal to the target, we don't need to add anything.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minAddToMakeIntegerBeautiful(int n, int target) {
        int sum = digitSum(n);
        return Math.max(0, target - sum);
    }

    private int digitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minAddToMakeIntegerBeautiful(int n, int target) {
        int sum = digitSum(n);
        return std::max(0, target - sum);
    }

    int digitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minAddToMakeIntegerBeautiful(self, n: int, target: int) -> int:
        def digitSum(n):
            return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

        sum_digits = digitSum(n)
        return max(0, target - sum_digits)
```
