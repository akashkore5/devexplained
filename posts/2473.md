## Explanation:

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a 2D DP array to keep track of the minimum cost to buy `i` kilograms of apples. We will iterate through the array and update the minimum cost based on the cost of buying single apples or bags of apples. At the end, we return the minimum cost to buy the required amount of apples.

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize a 1D DP array `dp` of size `n+1` where `n` is the required amount of apples.
2. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` since the cost to buy 0 kilograms of apples is 0.
3. Iterate from `1` to `n` and for each `i`:
   - Calculate the cost of buying a single apple and a bag of apples.
   - Update `dp[i]` as the minimum of these two costs.
4. Return `dp[n]` which represents the minimum cost to buy `n` kilograms of apples.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

:

```java
public int minCostToBuyApples(int[] prices, int[] bags) {
    int n = bags.length;
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int singleAppleCost = i <= prices.length ? prices[i - 1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int bagCost = bags[i - 1];
        dp[i] = Math.min(singleAppleCost, bagCost + (i > 1 ? dp[i - 1] : 0));
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int minCostToBuyApples(vector<int>& prices, vector<int>& bags) {
    int n = bags.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int singleAppleCost = i <= prices.size() ? prices[i - 1] : INT_MAX;
        int bagCost = bags[i - 1];
        dp[i] = min(singleAppleCost, bagCost + (i > 1 ? dp[i - 1] : 0));
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

### Python
```python
def minCostToBuyApples(prices, bags):
    n = len(bags)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        single_apple_cost = prices[i - 1] if i <= len(prices) else float('inf')
        bag_cost = bags[i - 1]
        dp[i] = min(single_apple_cost, bag_cost + dp[i - 1] if i > 1 else 0)
    return dp[n]
```
