## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a modified in-order traversal of the binary search tree. At each node, we compare the node's value with the query value to update the closest smaller and closest larger values found so far. We update these values as we traverse down the tree, ensuring that we maintain the closest values to the query.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize two variables `closestSmaller` and `closestLarger` to store the closest smaller and larger values found so far.
2. Traverse the binary search tree in an in-order manner.
3. At each node:
   - If the node's value is smaller than or equal to the query value, update `closestSmaller` if needed.
   - If the node's value is larger than or equal to the query value, update `closestLarger` if needed.
4. Continue the traversal until reaching the end of the tree.
5. Return the final closest smaller and closest larger values for each query.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for storing closest smaller and closest larger values.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] closestNodesQueries(TreeNode root, int[] queries) {
        int[][] answer = new int[queries.length][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int closestSmaller = -1;
            int closestLarger = -1;
            TreeNode curr = root;
            while (curr != null) {
                if (curr.val <= queries[i]) {
                    closestSmaller = curr.val;
                    curr = curr.right;
                } else {
                    closestLarger = curr.val;
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
            }
            answer[i][0] = closestSmaller;
            answer[i][1] = closestLarger;
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> closestNodesQueries(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& queries) {
        vector<vector<int>> answer(queries.size(), vector<int>(2));
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            int closestSmaller = -1;
            int closestLarger = -1;
            TreeNode* curr = root;
            while (curr != nullptr) {
                if (curr->val <= queries[i]) {
                    closestSmaller = curr->val;
                    curr = curr->right;
                } else {
                    closestLarger = curr->val;
                    curr = curr->left;
                }
            }
            answer[i][0] = closestSmaller;
            answer[i][1] = closestLarger;
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def closestNodesQueries(self, root: TreeNode, queries: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        answer = []
        for q in queries:
            closest_smaller = -1
            closest_larger = -1
            curr = root
            while curr:
                if curr.val <= q:
                    closest_smaller = curr.val
                    curr = curr.right
                else:
                    closest_larger = curr.val
                    curr = curr.left
            answer.append([closest_smaller, closest_larger])
        return answer
