### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the characters of the strings `s` and `t` simultaneously. We maintain two pointers, one for each string. If the characters at the current positions match, we move both pointers. If they don't match, we only move the pointer for string `s` and keep track of the number of characters we need to append to `s` to make `t` a subsequence of `s`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string between `s` and `t`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCharacters(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
                count++;
            }
        }

        count += t.length() - j;

        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCharacters(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
                count++;
            }
        }

        count += t.length() - j;

        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        i, j = 0, 0
        count = 0

        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                count += 1

        count += len(t) - j

        return count
```
