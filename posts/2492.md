### Explanation:
To find the minimum score of a path between cities 1 and n, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will start from city 1 and explore all possible paths to other cities while keeping track of the minimum distance encountered so far. Once we reach city n, we will have the minimum score of a path between cities 1 and n.

1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph where each city is connected to its neighboring cities with corresponding distances.
2. Initialize a priority queue (min heap) to store the cities to explore based on the minimum distance encountered so far.
3. Initialize an array to store the minimum distances from city 1 to each city.
4. Start with city 1, add it to the priority queue with distance 0.
5. While the priority queue is not empty, pop the city with the minimum distance.
6. For each neighboring city of the popped city, update the minimum distance if a shorter path is found and add the neighboring city to the priority queue.
7. Continue this process until we reach city n.
8. The minimum score of the path between cities 1 and n will be the minimum distance encountered at city n.

Time Complexity: O(ElogV), where E is the number of roads and V is the number of cities.
Space Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of cities and E is the number of roads.

            graph.computeIfAbsent(road[1], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{road[0], road[2]});
        }
