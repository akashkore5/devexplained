### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain a `dp` array to store the minimum cost at each stone. At each stone, we will iterate over all previous stones and calculate the cost of reaching the current stone from the previous stone. We will update the `dp` array with the minimum cost. Finally, we return the minimum cost at the last stone.

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `stones.length` to store the minimum cost at each stone. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 as the cost at the first stone is 0.
2. Iterate over all stones starting from the second stone.
3. For each stone, iterate over all previous stones and calculate the cost of jumping from the previous stone to the current stone.
4. Update the `dp` array with the minimum cost.
5. Return the minimum cost at the last stone.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of stones.  
Space Complexity: O(n) for the `dp` array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int cost = Math.max(stones[i] - stones[j], dp[j]);
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], cost);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& stones) {
        int n = stones.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 0);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = INT_MAX;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int cost = max(stones[i] - stones[j], dp[j]);
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(stones)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i] = float('inf')
            for j in range(i):
                cost = max(stones[i] - stones[j], dp[j])
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost)
        
        return dp[n - 1]
```
