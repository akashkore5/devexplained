### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the array and consider it as the starting point of a potential square streak. We then try to build the square streak by looking for the square of the current element in the remaining elements. If we find the square, we continue this process until we can no longer find the next square in the sequence.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize a variable `longestStreak` to keep track of the maximum square streak length found so far.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element `num[i]`, try to build a square streak starting from `num[i]`.
4. Check if `num[i] * num[i]` exists in `nums`, if it does, increment the streak length by 1 and update the current element to the square found.
5. Continue this process until we can no longer find the next square in the sequence.
6. Update `longestStreak` if the current streak is longer.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSquareStreak(int[] nums) {
        int longestStreak = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int curr = nums[i];
            int streak = 1;
            while (true) {
                int next = curr * curr;
                boolean found = false;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if (nums[j] == next) {
                        streak++;
                        curr = nums[j];
                        found = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!found) break;
            }
            longestStreak = Math.max(longestStreak, streak);
        }
        return longestStreak >= 2 ? longestStreak : -1;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSquareStreak(vector<int>& nums) {
        int longestStreak = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int curr = nums[i];
            int streak = 1;
            while (true) {
                int next = curr * curr;
                bool found = false;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                    if (nums[j] == next) {
                        streak++;
                        curr = nums[j];
                        found = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (!found) break;
            }
            longestStreak = max(longestStreak, streak);
        }
        return longestStreak >= 2 ? longestStreak : -1;
    }
};

```python

            streak = 1
            while True:
                next_val = curr * curr
                found = False
                for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                    if nums[j] == next_val:
                        streak += 1
                        curr = nums[j]
                        found = True
                        break

                    break
            longestStreak = max(longestStreak, streak)
        return longestStreak if longestStreak >= 2 else -1
