### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate through each query and traverse the grid starting from the top left cell. We keep track of the maximum points we can obtain for each query based on the given conditions.

1. Start from the top left cell of the matrix.
2. For each query:
   - If the current cell value is less than the query value, increment the points and explore adjacent cells.
   - Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.

Time Complexity: O(m*n*k) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid and k is the number of queries.
Space Complexity: O(m*n) for the visited array.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxPoints(int[][] grid, int[] queries) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int points = 0;
            boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
            dfs(grid, visited, 0, 0, queries[i], m, n, points);
            answer[i] = points;
        }

        return answer;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, int x, int y, int query, int m, int n, int points) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || visited[x][y] || grid[x][y] < query) {
            return;
        }

        points++;
        visited[x][y] = true;
        dfs(grid, visited, x + 1, y, query, m, n, points);
        dfs(grid, visited, x - 1, y, query, m, n, points);
        dfs(grid, visited, x, y + 1, query, m, n, points);
        dfs(grid, visited, x, y - 1, query, m, n, points);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<int>& queries) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<int> answer;

        for (int q : queries) {
            int points = 0;
            vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
            dfs(grid, visited, 0, 0, q, m, n, points);
            answer.push_back(points);
        }

        return answer;
    }

    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, int x, int y, int query, int m, int n, int& points) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || visited[x][y] || grid[x][y] < query) {
            return;
        }

        points++;
        visited[x][y] = true;
        dfs(grid, visited, x + 1, y, query, m, n, points);
        dfs(grid, visited, x - 1, y, query, m, n, points);
        dfs(grid, visited, x, y + 1, query, m, n, points);
        dfs(grid, visited, x, y - 1, query, m, n, points);
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, grid: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        answer = []

        def dfs(x, y, query, points, visited):
            if x < 0 or x >= m or y < 0 or y >= n or visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] < query:
                return

            points[0] += 1
            visited[x][y] = True
            dfs(x + 1, y, query, points, visited)
            dfs(x - 1, y, query, points, visited)
            dfs(x, y + 1, query, points, visited)
            dfs(x, y - 1, query, points, visited)

        for q in queries:
            points = [0]
            visited = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
            dfs(0, 0, q, points, visited)
            answer.append(points[0])

        return answer
