## Explanation:
To concatenate the name and the profession, we simply need to join the two strings with a space in between. The resulting string will be the concatenated name and profession.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the name and profession strings.
- Space complexity: O(n) for the resulting concatenated string.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String concatenateNameAndProfession(String name, String profession) {
        return name + " " + profession;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string concatenateNameAndProfession(string name, string profession) {
        return name + " " + profession;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def concatenateNameAndProfession(self, name: str, profession: str) -> str:
        return name + " " + profession
```
