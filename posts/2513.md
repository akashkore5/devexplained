### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to distribute numbers in two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` such that they satisfy the given conditions. We want to minimize the maximum value in either array. We can start by distributing numbers in such a way that we minimize the maximum value. 

We know that we need to have `uniqueCnt1` distinct numbers in `arr1` and `uniqueCnt2` distinct numbers in `arr2`, and none of these numbers should be divisible by `divisor1` or `divisor2` respectively. We can start by assigning the smallest possible numbers to these arrays. 

We can start by iterating from 1 and keep adding numbers to `arr1` and `arr2` such that they do not violate the conditions provided. We can stop this process when both `arr1` and `arr2` have the required number of distinct elements. The maximum value in either array at this point would be the answer.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the sum of `uniqueCnt1` and `uniqueCnt2`. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from the input and output variables.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizeTheMax(int divisor1, int divisor2, int uniqueCnt1, int uniqueCnt2) {
        int maxVal = 0;
        int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; count1 < uniqueCnt1 || count2 < uniqueCnt2; i++) {
            if (i % divisor1 != 0 && count1 < uniqueCnt1) {
                maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, i);
                count1++;
            }
            if (i % divisor2 != 0 && count2 < uniqueCnt2) {
                maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, i);
                count2++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxVal;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizeTheMax(int divisor1, int divisor2, int uniqueCnt1, int uniqueCnt2) {
        int maxVal = 0;
        int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; count1 < uniqueCnt1 || count2 < uniqueCnt2; i++) {
            if (i % divisor1 != 0 && count1 < uniqueCnt1) {
                maxVal = max(maxVal, i);
                count1++;
            }
            if (i % divisor2 != 0 && count2 < uniqueCnt2) {
                maxVal = max(maxVal, i);
                count2++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxVal;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeTheMax(self, divisor1: int, divisor2: int, uniqueCnt1: int, uniqueCnt2: int) -> int:
        maxVal = 0
        count1 = 0
        count2 = 0
        
        i = 1
        while count1 < uniqueCnt1 or count2 < uniqueCnt2:
            if i % divisor1 != 0 and count1 < uniqueCnt1:
                maxVal = max(maxVal, i)
                count1 += 1
            if i % divisor2 != 0 and count2 < uniqueCnt2:
                maxVal = max(maxVal, i)
                count2 += 1
            i += 1
        
        return maxVal
```
