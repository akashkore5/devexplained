## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the circular array of words starting from the given `startIndex`. For each step in either direction (next or previous), we calculate the minimum distance to reach the target string. We keep track of the minimum distance seen so far and return it as the final answer.

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize `minDistance` to a large number and set `found` flag to false.
2. Iterate through the circular array starting from `startIndex`.
3. For each position, calculate the distance to the target string in both directions (next and previous).
4. Update `minDistance` with the minimum of the previous minimum distance and the newly calculated distances.
5. If the target string is found at any position, set `found` flag to true.
6. Finally, return `-1` if the target string was not found, else return the `minDistance`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N) where N is the number of words in the array. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String target, int startIndex) {
        int n = words.length;
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        boolean found = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (words[i].equals(target)) {
                found = true;
                int distance = Math.min(Math.abs(i - startIndex), n - Math.abs(i - startIndex));
                minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, distance);
            }
        }

        return found ? minDistance : -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string target, int startIndex) {
        int n = words.size();
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        bool found = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (words[i] == target) {
                found = true;
                int distance = min(abs(i - startIndex), n - abs(i - startIndex));
                minDistance = min(minDistance, distance);
            }
        }

        return found ? minDistance : -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, words: List[str], target: str, startIndex: int) -> int:
        n = len(words)
        minDistance = float('inf')
        found = False

        for i in range(n):
            if words[i] == target:
                found = True
                distance = min(abs(i - startIndex), n - abs(i - startIndex))
                minDistance = min(minDistance, distance)

        return minDistance if found else -1
