### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window that contains at least `k` occurrences of each character. We will expand the window by moving the right pointer to the right until we have at least `k` occurrences of each character in the window. Then, we will contract the window by moving the left pointer to the right until we no longer have `k` occurrences of each character in the window.

We will keep track of the minimum number of minutes needed to achieve at least `k` occurrences of each character. If it is not possible to achieve this, we will return -1.
 Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMinutes(String s, int k) {
        int[] count = new int[3]; // to store the count of 'a', 'b', 'c'
        int total = 0; // total count of characters in the window
        int left = 0, right = 0; // window pointers
        int minMinutes = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[ch - 'a']++;
            total++;

            while (count[0] >= k && count[1] >= k && count[2] >= k) {
                minMinutes = Math.min(minMinutes, total);
                count[s.charAt(left) - 'a']--;
                total--;
                left++;
            }
        }

        return minMinutes == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minMinutes;
    }
}
```

### C++ Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMinutes(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> count(3, 0); // to store the count of 'a', 'b', 'c'
        int total = 0; // total count of characters in the window
        int left = 0, right = 0; // window pointers
        int minMinutes = INT_MAX;

        for (char ch : s) {
            count[ch - 'a']++;
            total++;

            while (count[0] >= k && count[1] >= k && count[2] >= k) {
                minMinutes = min(minMinutes, total);
                count[s[left] - 'a']--;
                total--;
                left++;
            }
        }

        return minMinutes == INT_MAX ? -1 : minMinutes;
    }
};
```

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minMinutes(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = [0, 0, 0] # to store the count of 'a', 'b', 'c'
        total = 0 # total count of characters in the window
        left = 0
        min_minutes = float('inf')

        for ch in s:
            count[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
            total += 1

            while all(c >= k for c in count):
                min_minutes = min(min_minutes, total)
                count[ord(s[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1
                total -= 1
                left += 1

        return min_minutes if min_minutes != float('inf') else -1
```
