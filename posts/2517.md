### Explanation:

To find the maximum tastiness of a candy basket, we need to choose k distinct candies with the smallest absolute price difference. We can achieve this by sorting the prices and then iterating over the sorted array to find the minimum difference between any two prices in a window of size k.

Algorithm:
1. Sort the prices array in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize a variable `minDiff` to store the minimum difference between any two prices.
3. Iterate over the sorted array from index 0 to n-k (n is the total number of candies).
4. Calculate the difference between prices at current index and index k-1 ahead.
5. Update `minDiff` with the minimum of current minDiff and the calculated difference.
6. Return `minDiff` as the maximum tastiness of the candy basket.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the length of the prices array due to sorting.
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are not using any extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTastiness(int[] price, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(price);
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= price.length - k; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, price[i + k - 1] - price[i]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTastiness(vector<int>& price, int k) {
        sort(price.begin(), price.end());
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i <= price.size() - k; i++) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, price[i + k - 1] - price[i]);
        }
        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxTastiness(self, price: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        price.sort()
        min_diff = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(price) - k + 1):
            min_diff = min(min_diff, price[i + k - 1] - price[i])
        return min_diff
```
