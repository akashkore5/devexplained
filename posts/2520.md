### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate through each digit of the given number and check if the number is divisible by that digit. If it is, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter as the result.

- Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the count of divisible digits.
- Iterate through each digit of the given number.
- Check if the digit is not zero and the number is divisible by that digit.
- If the above conditions are met, increment the counter.
- Return the counter as the result.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), where n is the given number. This is because we are iterating through each digit of the number.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countDividingDigits(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = num;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            if (digit != 0 && num % digit == 0) {
                count++;
            }
            n /= 10;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDividingDigits(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = num;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            if (digit != 0 && num % digit == 0) {
                count++;
            }
            n /= 10;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countDividingDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        n = num
        while n > 0:
            digit = n % 10
            if digit != 0 and num % digit == 0:
                count += 1
            n //= 10
        return count
```
