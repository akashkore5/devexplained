## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the time taken for each person to cross the door. We will iterate through the given array of times and simulate the process of people crossing the door. 

For each person, we will check if there is space for them to cross immediately. If there is space, we update the current time to be the maximum of the current time and the person's arrival time. If there is no space, we add the person's crossing time to the current time and update the total time taken to cross the door.

After iterating through all the people, the total time taken to cross the door will be the maximum of the current time and the last person's arrival time.

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort the given array of times in ascending order.
2. Initialize a priority queue to store the times taken for each person to cross the door.
3. Initialize a variable `currentTime` to keep track of the current time.
4. Iterate through the sorted array of times:
   - If there is space for the current person to cross immediately, update the `currentTime` to be the maximum of the current time and the person's arrival time.
   - If there is no space, add the person's crossing time to the `currentTime` and update the total time taken to cross the door.
5. Return the maximum of the `currentTime` and the last person's arrival time as the total time taken to cross the door.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Sorting the array of times takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of people.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Using a priority queue to store the times taken for each person.

```java

import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int timeTakenToCrossDoor(int[] times) {
        Arrays.sort(times);
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int currentTime = 0;
        
        for (int time : times) {
            if (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() <= currentTime) {
                pq.poll();
            } else {
                currentTime = time;
            }
            pq.offer(time + 3);
        }
        
        return Math.max(currentTime, pq.peek());
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int timeTakenToCrossDoor(std::vector<int>& times) {
        std::sort(times.begin(), times.end());
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq;
        int currentTime = 0;
        
        for (int time : times) {
            if (!pq.empty() && pq.top() <= currentTime) {
                pq.pop();
            } else {
                currentTime = time;
            }
            pq.push(time + 3);
        }
        
        return std::max(currentTime, pq.top());
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def time_taken_to_cross_door(self, times: List[int]) -> int:
        times.sort()
        pq = []
        currentTime = 0
        
        for time in times:
            while pq and pq[0] <= currentTime:
                heapq.heappop(pq)
            if pq:
                currentTime = max(currentTime, time)
            heapq.heappush(pq, time + 3)
        
        return max(currentTime, pq[0])
