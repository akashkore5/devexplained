## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to sort the students based on their scores in the kth exam. We can achieve this by using a custom comparator to sort the rows of the matrix based on the kth element in each row.

1. Create a custom comparator that compares rows based on the kth element.
2. Sort the rows of the matrix using the custom comparator.
3. Return the sorted matrix.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(m log m) where m is the number of students.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are sorting the matrix in-place.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] sortStudentsByScore(int[][] score, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(score, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[k], a[k]));
        return score;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> sortStudentsByScore(vector<vector<int>>& score, int k) {
        sort(score.begin(), score.end(), [&](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return b[k] < a[k];
        });
        return score;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def sortStudentsByScore(self, score: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        score.sort(key=lambda x: x[k], reverse=True)
        return score
```
