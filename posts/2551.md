### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to distribute the marbles into k bags while minimizing the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions. We will approach this problem using binary search and prefix sum techniques.

1. **Algorithm:**
   - We start by initializing two variables `low` and `high` where `low` is the minimum possible score (sum of all weights) and `high` is the maximum possible score (sum of maximum k weights).
   - Perform binary search in the range [low, high] to find the optimal score.
   - In each binary search iteration, calculate the mid value and check if it's feasible to distribute the marbles such that the maximum bag cost is less than or equal to the mid value.
   - If feasible, update the answer and move towards the left half, else move towards the right half.
   
2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of this approach is O(n log(sum(weights))) where n is the number of marbles and sum(weights) represents the sum of all marble weights.

3. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] weights, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(weights);
        int n = weights.length;
        if (k >= n) return 0;
        
        int low = Arrays.stream(weights).sum();
        int high = Arrays.stream(weights).skip(n - k).sum();
        
        int res = high - low;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res = Math.min(res, high - low);
            low += weights[i];
            high += weights[n - k + i];
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& weights, int k) {
        sort(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        int n = weights.size();
        if (k >= n) return 0;
        
        int low = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
        int high = accumulate(weights.begin() + n - k, weights.end(), 0);
        
        int res = high - low;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res = min(res, high - low);
            low += weights[i];
            high += weights[n - k + i];
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, weights: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        weights.sort()
        n = len(weights)
        if k >= n:
            return 0
        
        low = sum(weights)
        high = sum(weights[n - k:])
        
        res = high - low
        for i in range(k):
            res = min(res, high - low)
            low += weights[i]
            high += weights[n - k + i]
        
        return res
```
