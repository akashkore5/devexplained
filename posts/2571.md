### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can start by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 from the given number until it reaches 0. We can easily determine the largest power of 2 by finding the highest bit set in the binary representation of the number. The number of operations required will be equal to the count of set bits in the binary representation of the input number.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
2. While the input number `n` is greater than 0:
   - Find the highest bit set in `n` (which corresponds to the largest power of 2).
   - Subtract that power of 2 from `n`.
   - Increment `count` by 1.
3. Return the final value of `count`.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), where n is the input number.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int largestPowerOf2 = Integer.highestOneBit(n);
            n -= largestPowerOf2;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int largestPowerOf2 = 1 << (31 - __builtin_clz(n));
            n -= largestPowerOf2;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n > 0:
            largest_power_of_2 = 1 << (n.bit_length() - 1)
            n -= largest_power_of_2
            count += 1
        return count
```
