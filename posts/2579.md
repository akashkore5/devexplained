### Explanation:
The problem can be solved by simulating the coloring process for n minutes. We can use a set to keep track of the colored cells at each minute. Starting with one cell colored blue at minute 0, we can iterate over n minutes and color all uncolored cells that are adjacent to the already colored cells. By doing this, we can count the total number of colored cells at the end of n minutes.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a set to store colored cells and add the first cell at minute 0.
2. Repeat the following steps for n minutes:
   - Create a new set to store newly colored cells.
   - Iterate over all colored cells in the previous minute and check all adjacent uncolored cells.
   - Add newly colored cells to the new set.
   - Update the colored cells set with the new set.
3. Return the size of the colored cells set as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of minutes.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) to store the colored cells set.

```java
class Solution {
    public int coloredCells(int n) {
        Set<Integer> coloredCells = new HashSet<>();
        coloredCells.add(0);
        
        for (int minute = 1; minute <= n; minute++) {
            Set<Integer> newColoredCells = new HashSet<>();
            for (int cell : coloredCells) {
                int x = cell / 10000;
                int y = cell % 10000;
                int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
                for (int[] dir : directions) {
                    int newX = x + dir[0];
                    int newY = y + dir[1];
                    int newCell = newX * 10000 + newY;
                    if (!coloredCells.contains(newCell)) {
                        newColoredCells.add(newCell);
                    }
                }
            }
            coloredCells.addAll(newColoredCells);

        return coloredCells.size();
