### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible root nodes and check how many correct guesses each root node leads to. For each root node, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that node and check if the guesses are consistent with the tree structure. We keep track of the number of correct guesses for each root node and return the count of root nodes that lead to at least `k` correct guesses.

- Initialize a graph data structure from the given edges.
- Iterate through all possible root nodes (0 to n-1):
  - Perform a DFS starting from the current root node.
  - Check if the guesses are consistent with the DFS traversal.
  - Count the number of correct guesses.
- Return the count of root nodes that lead to at least `k` correct guesses.

Time complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes  
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the graph and visited nodes
