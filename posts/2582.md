## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the passing of the pillow among n people for a given time duration. We can track the current position of the pillow holder and the direction of passing. By updating the position based on the direction and handling the edge cases when the position reaches the end of the line, we can determine the final holder of the pillow after the given time.

- We start with the person at position 1 holding the pillow.
- We keep track of the current position and the direction of passing.
- We update the position based on the direction and handle the cases when the position reaches the ends of the line.
- We repeat this process for the given time duration to find the final holder of the pillow.

Time Complexity: O(time)
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        int position = 1;
        int direction = 1; // 1 for moving right, -1 for moving left

        for (int i = 0; i < time; i++) {
            if (position == 1) {
                direction = 1;
            } else if (position == n) {
                direction = -1;
            }
            position += direction;
        }

        return position;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        int position = 1;
        int direction = 1; // 1 for moving right, -1 for moving left

        for (int i = 0; i < time; i++) {
            if (position == 1) {
                direction = 1;
            } else if (position == n) {
                direction = -1;
            }
            position += direction;
        }

        return position;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def pass_the_pillow(self, n: int, time: int) -> int:
        position = 1
        direction = 1  # 1 for moving right, -1 for moving left

        for i in range(time):
            if position == 1:
                direction = 1
            elif position == n:
                direction = -1
            position += direction

        return position
