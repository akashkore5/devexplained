### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to earn exactly j points using the first i types of questions. We initialize dp[0][0] to 1 as there is one way to earn 0 points with 0 types of questions.

For each type of question, we iterate over the possible number of questions of that type that can be used to earn points. We update the dp array accordingly for each type and cumulative points.

Finally, the answer will be stored in dp[n][target] where n is the total number of types of questions.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * target) where n is the number of types of questions and target is the target number of points.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n * target) for the dp array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(int target, int[][] types) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int n = types.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][target + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k <= types[i - 1][0]; k++) {
                    if (j - k * types[i - 1][1] >= 0) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - k * types[i - 1][1]]) % mod;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][target];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int target, vector<vector<int>>& types) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int n = types.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(target + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k <= types[i - 1][0]; k++) {
                    if (j - k * types[i - 1][1] >= 0) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - k * types[i - 1][1]]) % mod;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][target];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, target: int, types: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        mod = 1000000007
        n = len(types)
        dp = [[0] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(target + 1):
                for k in range(types[i - 1][0] + 1):
                    if j - k * types[i - 1][1] >= 0:
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - k * types[i - 1][1]]) % mod
        
        return dp[n][target]
