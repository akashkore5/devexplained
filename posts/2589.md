### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks. We can achieve this by iterating over the tasks and calculating the total time needed to complete each task. We can then find the total time the computer needs to be turned on by considering the intervals where tasks are running.

1. Sort the tasks based on their end times.
2. Initialize variables `timeOn` and `prevEnd` to track the current time the computer is turned on and the end time of the previous task.
3. Iterate through the sorted tasks.
4. For each task:
    - If the task's start time is greater than the `prevEnd`, update `timeOn` to include the duration of the current task.
    - Else, update `timeOn` by adding the difference between the current task's end time and the `prevEnd`.
    - Update `prevEnd` to the end time of the current task.
5. Return the final `timeOn` as the minimum time the computer needs to be turned on.

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n is the number of tasks. Sorting the tasks takes O(n log n) time.

**Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToCompleteAllTasks(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        int timeOn = 0, prevEnd = -1;
        for (int[] task : tasks) {
            if (task[0] > prevEnd) {
                timeOn += task[2];
            } else {
                timeOn += task[2] - (prevEnd - task[0]);
            }
            prevEnd = task[1];
        }
        return timeOn;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToCompleteAllTasks(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
        sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        int timeOn = 0, prevEnd = -1;
        for (auto& task : tasks) {
            if (task[0] > prevEnd) {
                timeOn += task[2];
            } else {
                timeOn += task[2] - (prevEnd - task[0]);
            }
            prevEnd = task[1];
        }
        
        return timeOn;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToCompleteAllTasks(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        time_on = 0
        prev_end = -1
        for task in tasks:
            if task[0] > prev_end:
                time_on += task[2]
            else:
                time_on += task[2] - (prev_end - task[0])
            prev_end = task[1]
        
        return time_on
```
