### Explanation:

To design a Todo List system, we can use a Priority Queue to store the tasks based on their priority. Each task can have a priority level, a description, and a deadline. The Priority Queue will ensure that the tasks are ordered based on their priority level, with higher priority tasks being processed first. We can implement methods to add a new task, mark a task as completed, and get the next task to work on.

1. **Add Task (with priority, description, and deadline):**
   - Create a Task object with the given priority, description, and deadline.
   - Add the Task to the Priority Queue based on its priority level.

2. **Mark Task as Completed:**
   - Remove the highest priority task from the Priority Queue (indicating it has been completed).

3. **Get Next Task:**
   - Peek at the highest priority task in the Priority Queue to get the next task to work on.

*Time Complexity Analysis:*
- Adding a task: O(log n) due to adding to the Priority Queue.
- Marking a task as completed: O(log n) due to removing from the Priority Queue.
- Getting the next task: O(1) to peek at the highest priority task.

*Space Complexity:*
- O(n) where n is the number of tasks in the Priority Queue.

:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Task {
    int priority;
    String description;
    String deadline;

    public Task(int priority, String description, String deadline) {
        this.priority = priority;
        this.description = description;
        this.deadline = deadline;
    }
}

class TodoList {
    PriorityQueue<Task> tasks;

    public TodoList() {
        tasks = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b.priority - a.priority);
    }

    public void addTask(int priority, String description, String deadline) {
        tasks.offer(new Task(priority, description, deadline));
    }

    public void markTaskAsCompleted() {
        tasks.poll();
    }

    public Task getNextTask() {
        return tasks.peek();
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <string>

struct Task {
    int priority;
    std::string description;
    std::string deadline;

    Task(int prio, std::string desc, std::string ddl) : priority(prio), description(desc), deadline(ddl) {}
};

class TodoList {
private:
    std::priority_queue<Task, std::vector<Task>, std::function<bool(Task, Task)>> tasks;

public:
    TodoList() : tasks([](Task a, Task b) { return a.priority < b.priority; }) {}

    void addTask(int priority, std::string description, std::string deadline) {
        tasks.push(Task(priority, description, deadline));
    }

    void markTaskAsCompleted() {
        tasks.pop();
    }

    Task getNextTask() {
        return tasks.top();
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class TodoList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def addTask(self, priority, description, deadline):
        heapq.heappush(self.tasks, (-priority, description, deadline))

    def markTaskAsCompleted(self):
        heapq.heappop(self.tasks)

    def getNextTask(self):
        return self.tasks[0][1:]
```
