### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to distribute the money among the children in such a way that each child gets at least 1 dollar and nobody receives 4 dollars. We are looking to maximize the number of children who receive exactly 8 dollars.

We can distribute the money by following these steps:
1. If the money is less than 2 or greater than 200, or the number of children is less than 2 or greater than 30, return -1 as it is not possible to distribute the money.
2. Calculate the maximum number of children who can receive 8 dollars by dividing the money by 8.
3. Check if this number is greater than the total number of children. If it is, return the total number of children. Otherwise, return the calculated maximum number of children.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as it does a constant number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int distributeMoneyToChildren(int money, int children) {
        if (money < 2 || money > 200 || children < 2 || children > 30) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int maxChildrenWith8 = money / 8;
        return Math.min(maxChildrenWith8, children);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int distributeMoneyToChildren(int money, int children) {
        if (money < 2 || money > 200 || children < 2 || children > 30) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int maxChildrenWith8 = money / 8;
        return min(maxChildrenWith8, children);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def distributeMoneyToChildren(self, money: int, children: int) -> int:
        if money < 2 or money > 200 or children < 2 or children > 30:
            return -1
        
        max_children_with_8 = money // 8
        return min(max_children_with_8, children)
```
