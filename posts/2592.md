## Explanation
To maximize the greatness of the array, we need to rearrange the elements in such a way that as many elements are greater than their original positions as possible. We can achieve this by sorting the array and then comparing each element with its original position. The difference between the number of elements that are greater than their original positions and the index of the element is the greatness for that element. We find the maximum greatness among all elements to get the maximum possible greatness after the permutation.

- Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
- For each element, compare it with its original index.
- Calculate the greatness for each element.
- Find the maximum greatness among all elements.
- Return the maximum greatness.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the array due to sorting.
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the sorted array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximizeGreatness(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int maxGreatness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            maxGreatness = Math.max(maxGreatness, nums[i] - i);
        }
        return maxGreatness;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeGreatness(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int maxGreatness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            maxGreatness = max(maxGreatness, nums[i] - i);
        }
        return maxGreatness;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeGreatness(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        maxGreatness = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            maxGreatness = max(maxGreatness, nums[i] - i)
        return maxGreatness
```
