## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array while keeping track of the unmarked elements. We will repeatedly choose the smallest unmarked element, mark it and its adjacent elements if they exist, and add its value to the score. This process continues until all elements are marked.

We can use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently find the smallest unmarked element at each step. We will also maintain a set to keep track of marked elements. 

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the array
Space complexity: O(n) 
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int arrayScore(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> unmarked = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            unmarked.offer(num);
        }

        Set<Integer> marked = new HashSet<>();
        int score = 0;

        while (!unmarked.isEmpty()) {
            int current = unmarked.poll();
            if (marked.contains(current)) {
                continue;
            }
            score += current;
            marked.add(current);

            if (marked.contains(current - 1)) {
                unmarked.remove(current - 1);
                marked.add(current - 1);
            }
            if (marked.contains(current + 1)) {
                unmarked.remove(current + 1);
                marked.add(current + 1);
            }
        }

        return score;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int arrayScore(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> unmarked;
        for (int num : nums) {
            unmarked.push(num);
        }

        std::unordered_set<int> marked;
        int score = 0;

        while (!unmarked.empty()) {
            int current = unmarked.top();
            unmarked.pop();
            if (marked.count(current)) {
                continue;
            }
            score += current;
            marked.insert(current);

            if (marked.count(current - 1)) {
                marked.insert(current - 1);
            }
            if (marked.count(current + 1)) {
                marked.insert(current + 1);
            }
        }

        return score;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def arrayScore(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        unmarked = list(nums)
        heapq.heapify(unmarked)
        marked = set()
        score = 0

        while unmarked:
            current = heapq.heappop(unmarked)
            if current in marked:
                continue
            score += current
            marked.add(current)

            if current - 1 in marked:
                marked.add(current - 1)
            if current + 1 in marked:
                marked.add(current + 1)

        return score
```
