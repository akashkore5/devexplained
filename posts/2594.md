### Explanation:
To minimize the time taken to repair all cars, we need to assign cars to mechanics in a way that minimizes the overall time. We can achieve this by assigning cars to mechanics with the lowest ranks first, as they are the most efficient in terms of repair time per car.

1. Sort the mechanics based on their ranks in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize a variable `totalTime` to store the total time taken to repair all cars.
3. Iterate over the sorted mechanics:
   - Calculate the number of cars that can be assigned to the current mechanic based on their rank and the total number of cars left to be repaired.
   - Update `totalTime` by adding the time taken by the current mechanic to repair the assigned cars.
4. Return `totalTime` as the minimum time taken to repair all cars.

**Time Complexity:** Sorting the mechanics takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of mechanics. The subsequent iteration takes O(n) time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

**Space Complexity:** We use additional space for sorting the mechanics, resulting in O(n) space complexity.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToRepairCars(int[] ranks, int cars) {
        Arrays.sort(ranks);
        int totalTime = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (cars > 0) {
            int numCars = Math.min(ranks[i], cars);
            totalTime += ranks[i] * numCars * numCars;
            cars -= numCars;
            i++;
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToRepairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
        sort(ranks.begin(), ranks.end());
        int totalTime = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (cars > 0) {
            int numCars = min(ranks[i], cars);
            totalTime += ranks[i] * numCars * numCars;
            cars -= numCars;
            i++;
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToRepairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:
        ranks.sort()
        total_time = 0
        i = 0
        
        while cars > 0:
            num_cars = min(ranks[i], cars)
            total_time += ranks[i] * num_cars * num_cars
            cars -= num_cars
            i += 1
        
        return total_time
```
