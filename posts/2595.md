## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of 1s at even and odd positions in the binary representation of the given integer `n`. We can do this by iterating through the binary representation of `n` and counting the number of 1s at even and odd positions.

1. Initialize two variables `even` and `odd` to count the number of 1s at even and odd positions.
2. Iterate through the binary representation of `n` from right to left.
3. Keep track of the position (index) of the bit, starting from index 0 for the rightmost bit.
4. If the current bit is 1 and the position is even, increment the `even` count. If the position is odd, increment the `odd` count.
5. Return the array `[even, odd]`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the given integer. This is because we need to iterate through the binary representation of `n`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int even = 0, odd = 0;
        int position = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if ((n & 1) == 1) {
                if (position % 2 == 0) {
                    even++;
                } else {
                    odd++;
                }
            }
            n = n >> 1;
            position++;
        }
        return new int[]{even, odd};
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        int even = 0, odd = 0;
        int position = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n & 1) {
                if (position % 2 == 0) {
                    even++;
                } else {
                    odd++;
                }
            }
            n = n >> 1;
            position++;
        }
        return {even, odd};
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        even, odd = 0, 0
        position = 0
        while n > 0:
            if n & 1:
                if position % 2 == 0:
                    even += 1
                else:
                    odd += 1
            n >>= 1
            position += 1
        return [even, odd]
```
