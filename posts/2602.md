### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal to each query value. We can do this by calculating the sum of absolute differences between each element of the array and the query value. The sum of these absolute differences will give us the total number of operations needed to make all elements equal to the query value.

### Algorithm:
1. Iterate through each query value.
2. For each query value, calculate the sum of absolute differences between each element in the array and the query value.
3. Add this sum to the answer array.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all query values.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * m), where n is the number of elements in the array and m is the number of queries.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(m), where m is the number of queries.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(int[] nums, int[] queries) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int m = queries.length;
        int[] answer = new int[m];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += Math.abs(nums[j] - queries[i]);
            }
            answer[i] = sum;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minOperations(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& queries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = queries.size();
        vector<int> answer(m, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum += abs(nums[j] - queries[i]);
            }
            answer[i] = sum;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer = []
        n = len(nums)
        m = len(queries)
        
        for i in range(m):
            sum = 0
            for j in range(n):
                sum += abs(nums[j] - queries[i])
            answer.append(sum)
        
        return answer
```
