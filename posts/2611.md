### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 3D dp array where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum total points that can be achieved by the two mice if the first mouse eats j types of cheese from the first i types of cheese, and the second mouse eats k types of cheese from the first i types of cheese.

We can iterate over all types of cheese and for each type, we have two choices:
1. The first mouse eats the cheese: dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k], dp[i-1][j-1][k] + reward1[i]).
2. The second mouse eats the cheese: dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k], dp[i-1][j][k-1] + reward2[i]).

Finally, the answer will be the maximum value of dp[n][k][k].

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2 * k), where n is the number of types of cheese and k is the number of types of cheese the first mouse eats.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(n * k^2).

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[] reward1, int[] reward2, int k) {
        int n = reward1.length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n+1][k+1][k+1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                for (int l = 0; l <= k; l++) {
                    dp[i][j][l] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j][l], (j > 0 ? dp[i-1][j-1][l] + reward1[i-1] : 0), (l > 0 ? dp[i-1][j][l-1] + reward2[i-1] : 0));
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k][k];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPoints(vector<int>& reward1, vector<int>& reward2, int k) {
        int n = reward1.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n+1, vector<vector<int>>(k+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0)));

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                for (int l = 0; l <= k; l++) {
                    dp[i][j][l] = max(dp[i-1][j][l], (j > 0 ? dp[i-1][j-1][l] + reward1[i-1] : 0), (l > 0 ? dp[i-1][j][l-1] + reward2[i-1] : 0));
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k][k];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, reward1: List[int], reward2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(reward1)
        dp = [[[0 for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(k+1):
                for l in range(k+1):
                    dp[i][j][l] = max(dp[i-1][j][l], (dp[i-1][j-1][l] + reward1[i-1] if j > 0 else 0), (dp[i-1][j][l-1] + reward2[i-1] if l > 0 else 0))

        return dp[n][k][k]
