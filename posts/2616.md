# Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the minimum maximum difference. We first sort the given array `nums`, then use binary search to find the optimal value for the maximum difference. For each value we choose in the binary search, we try to form `p` pairs of indices such that the maximum difference among the pairs is less than or equal to this chosen value. We can use a greedy approach to form these pairs.

We start by fixing the first pair's index at 0 and then try to find an index for the second pair such that the difference is less than or equal to the chosen value. We continue this process for all pairs. If at any point we can't find `p` valid pairs, we increase the chosen value for maximum difference in the binary search. If we can find `p` valid pairs for a chosen value, we try to minimize this value by moving to the left in the binary search.

At the end of binary search, the minimum maximum difference we found is the answer.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log(max-min)), where n is the length of the array `nums`, and max-min is the range of numbers in the array.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures other than a few variables.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int p) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        int left = 0, right = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (check(nums, p, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private boolean check(int[] nums, int p, int maxDiff) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i + p - 1 < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i + p - 1] - nums[i] <= maxDiff) {
                count = p;
                break;
            }
        }
