### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the `instanceof` operator in Java and Python. However, for a more generic solution that works across different languages, we can implement our own function to check if an object is an instance of a given class or superclass by checking if the object has access to the class's methods.

### Algorithm
1. Check if the given value is an instance of the given class by attempting to call a method specific to that class on the value.
2. If the method call is successful, return `true`, indicating that the object is an instance of the class.
3. If the method call results in an error or exception, catch the error and return `false`, indicating that the object is not an instance of the class.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are simply checking if the object has access to a method of the class.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input.

```java
public boolean checkIfInstanceOf(Object obj, Class<?> clazz) {
    try {
        clazz.cast(obj);
        return true;
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T, typename U>
bool checkIfInstanceOf(const T& obj, U* ptr) {
    try {
        dynamic_cast<U*>(obj);
        return true;
    } catch (std::bad_cast) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def check_if_instance_of(obj, cls):
    try:
        cls(obj)
        return True
    except TypeError:
        return False
```
