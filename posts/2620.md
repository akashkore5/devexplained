### Explanation:
To implement the counter function, we can simply use a variable to keep track of the current value to be returned. Each time the function is called, we increment this variable by 1 and return its current value. We can initialize this variable with the given input value `n`.

:

```java
class Counter {
    int currentVal;
    
    public Counter(int n) {
        this.currentVal = n;
    }
    
    public int call() {
        return currentVal++;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Counter {
private:
    int currentVal;
    
public:
    Counter(int n) {
        currentVal = n;
    }
    
    int call() {
        return currentVal++;
    }
};
```

```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.currentVal = n
    
    def call(self):
        val = self.currentVal
        self.currentVal += 1
        return val
```
