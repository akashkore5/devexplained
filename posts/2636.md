## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the promises in the pool. We will process promises in ascending order of their deadline. At each iteration, we will check if we have enough resources to fulfill the promise. If so, we will fulfill the promise and move to the next one. If not, we will skip the promise and move to the next one. We will continue this process until all promises are either fulfilled or skipped.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a priority queue to store promises based on their deadlines.
2. Iterate over the promises in ascending order of their deadlines.
3. For each promise, check if we have enough resources to fulfill it.
4. If we have enough resources, fulfill the promise and move to the next one.
5. If we don't have enough resources, skip the promise and move to the next one.
6. Repeat until all promises are either fulfilled or skipped.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) where n is the number of promises in the pool. This complexity is due to sorting the promises based on their deadlines and processing them in ascending order.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of promises in the pool. This is due to the priority queue used to store the promises.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Promise {
    int deadline;
    int resources;

    public Promise(int deadline, int resources) {
        this.deadline = deadline;
        this.resources = resources;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int promisePool(List<Promise> promises, int totalResources) {
        Collections.sort(promises, (a, b) -> a.deadline - b.deadline);

        int fulfilledPromises = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        for (Promise promise : promises) {
            if (promise.resources <= totalResources) {
                totalResources -= promise.resources;
                fulfilledPromises++;
            } else {
                pq.offer(promise.resources);
            }
        }
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() <= totalResources) {
            totalResources -= pq.poll();
            fulfilledPromises++;
        }
        
        return fulfilledPromises;
    }

    int promisePool(std::vector<Promise>& promises, int totalResources) {
        std::sort(promises.begin(), promises.end(), [](const Promise& p1, const Promise& p2) {

        });

        int fulfilledPromises = 0;

                totalResources -= promise.resources;
                fulfilledPromises++;
            } else {
                pq.push(promise.resources);
            }

        while (!pq.empty() && pq.top() <= totalResources) {
            totalResources -= pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            fulfilledPromises++;
        }

        return fulfilledPromises;

```python

class Solution:
    def promise_pool(self, promises, total_resources):
        promises.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        for deadline, resources in promises:

                total_resources -= resources
                fulfilled_promises += 1
            else:
