## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will start from the first ugly number which is 1, and then iteratively generate the next ugly numbers by multiplying the existing ugly numbers (1, 2, 3, 5) by 2, 3, and 5 respectively. We will keep track of the indices for each of the factors 2, 3, and 5 to generate the next ugly number. We will select the minimum of the three possible next ugly numbers and move the corresponding index forward. This process continues until we find the nth ugly number.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an array `ugly` to store the first n ugly numbers.
2. Initialize three pointers `p2`, `p3`, and `p5` to track the indices of factors 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
3. Initialize variables `next2`, `next3`, and `next5` to store the next possible ugly numbers by multiplying factors 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
4. Start iterating from index 1 to n-1:
   - Calculate the next possible ugly numbers by multiplying the factors with the current ugly numbers at indices `p2`, `p3`, and `p5`.
   - Select the minimum of `next2`, `next3`, and `next5` as the next ugly number, and update the corresponding pointer and increment the count.
5. Return the last element of the `ugly` array.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the input parameter denoting the nth ugly number to be found.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the array of n ugly numbers.
```java
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] ugly = new int[n];
        ugly[0] = 1;
        int p2 = 0, p3 = 0, p5 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int next2 = ugly[p2] * 2;
            int next3 = ugly[p3] * 3;
            int next5 = ugly[p5] * 5;
            
            ugly[i] = Math.min(next2, Math.min(next3, next5));
            
            if (ugly[i] == next2) p2++;
            if (ugly[i] == next3) p3++;
            if (ugly[i] == next5) p5++;
        }
        
        return ugly[n - 1];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        vector<int> ugly(n);
        ugly[0] = 1;
        int p2 = 0, p3 = 0, p5 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int next2 = ugly[p2] * 2;
            int next3 = ugly[p3] * 3;
            int next5 = ugly[p5] * 5;
            
            ugly[i] = min(next2, min(next3, next5));
            
            if (ugly[i] == next2) p2++;
            if (ugly[i] == next3) p3++;
            if (ugly[i] == next5) p5++;
        }
        
        return ugly[n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        ugly = [0] * n
        ugly[0] = 1
        p2, p3, p5 = 0, 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            next2, next3, next5 = ugly[p2] * 2, ugly[p3] * 3, ugly[p5] * 5
            ugly[i] = min(next2, next3, next5)
            
            if ugly[i] == next2:
                p2 += 1
            if ugly[i] == next3:
                p3 += 1
            if ugly[i] == next5:
                p5 += 1
        
        return ugly[n - 1]
