## Explanation
To generate the Fibonacci sequence, we can create a generator function that yields the Fibonacci numbers one by one. We can use a while loop inside the generator function to calculate the next Fibonacci number based on the previous two numbers. The generator function will keep track of the current and previous Fibonacci numbers.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a generator function `fibGenerator` that initializes `prev` and `curr` to 0 and 1 respectively.
2. Yield the first Fibonacci number which is 0.
3. Use a while loop that runs `callCount` times to generate the next Fibonacci numbers.
4. Calculate the next Fibonacci number as the sum of `prev` and `curr`.
5. Update `prev` and `curr` with the current values and yield the new Fibonacci number.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for `callCount` iterations.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of generating the Fibonacci sequence is O(n), where n is the `callCount`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the generator function is O(1) as we are only storing the previous and current Fibonacci numbers.
```java
import java.util.Iterator;

public class FibonacciGenerator implements Iterator<Integer> {
    private int prev = 0;
    private int curr = 1;
    private int count = 0;
    
    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer next() {
        if (count == 0) {
            count++;
            return prev;
        }
        
        int next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        count++;
        
        return prev;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class FibonacciGenerator {
private:
    int prev = 0;
    int curr = 1;
    int count = 0;

public:
    bool hasNext() {
        return true;
    }

    int next() {
        if (count == 0) {
            count++;
            return prev;
        }
        
        int next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        count++;
        
        return prev;
    }
};
```

```python
class FibonacciGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prev = 0
        self.curr = 1
        self.count = 0

    def next(self):
        if self.count == 0:
            self.count += 1
            return self.prev
        
        next_num = self.prev + self.curr
        self.prev = self.curr
        self.curr = next_num
        self.count += 1
        
        return self.prev
```
