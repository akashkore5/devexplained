**Explanation**

In this problem, we are given a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. We need to paint all houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color, and the total cost is minimized.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost of painting the first i houses with the ith house painted with color j. At each step, we update the dp array based on the minimum cost of painting the current house with each color considering the costs of the previous houses.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize the dp array of size n x k with all values set to infinity except for the first row which is the same as the costs matrix.
2. Iterate over the houses starting from the second house.
3. For each house, iterate over the colors and calculate the minimum cost of painting the current house with each color considering the costs of the previous houses with different colors.
4. Update the dp array with the minimum cost for each house and color combination.
5. Finally, return the minimum cost from the last row of the dp array.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * k^2) where n is the number of houses and k is the number of colors.
**Space Complexity:** O(n * k) for the dp array.

**Java**
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostII(int[][] costs) {
        if (costs == null || costs.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = costs.length;
        int k = costs[0].length;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][k];
        
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = costs[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int prev = 0; prev < k; prev++) {
                    if (prev != j) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][prev] + costs[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[n-1][j]);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
}
```

**C++**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostII(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        if (costs.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = costs.size();
        int k = costs[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(k, 0));
        
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = costs[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int prev = 0; prev < k; prev++) {
                    if (prev != j) {
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][prev] + costs[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int minCost = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            minCost = min(minCost, dp[n-1][j]);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
};
```

**Python**
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostII(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0
