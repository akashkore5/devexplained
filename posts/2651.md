## Explanation:
To calculate the delayed arrival time, we simply add the arrival time to the delayed time. If the sum exceeds 24 hours, we need to convert it to the 24-hour format (0-23 hours).

- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateDelayedArrivalTime(int arrivalTime, int delayedTime) {
        int totalHours = (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
        return totalHours;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int calculateDelayedArrivalTime(int arrivalTime, int delayedTime) {
        int totalHours = (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
        return totalHours;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def calculate_delayed_arrival_time(self, arrivalTime: int, delayedTime: int) -> int:
        total_hours = (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24
        return total_hours
```
