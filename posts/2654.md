## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and try to make all elements equal to 1. We will keep track of the operations needed to achieve this. We will use the property that the GCD of a number and 1 is always 1. We will start by finding the GCD of adjacent elements and replacing one of them with the GCD value until all elements are equal to 1. If at any point we encounter a number that is not divisible by 1, we know it is impossible to make all elements equal to 1.

**Algorithm:**
1. Iterate through the array and find the GCD of each pair of adjacent elements.
2. Replace one of the elements with the GCD value and increment the operations count.
3. Continue this process until all elements are equal to 1 or it is impossible.
4. Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to 1.

**Time Complexity:** O(nlog(max(nums)))
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] % 2 != 0) {
                return -1; // If any number is not divisible by 2, it is impossible
            }
            
            int gcd = gcd(nums[i], nums[i + 1]);
            nums[i + 1] = gcd;
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] % 2 != 0) {
                return -1; // If any number is not divisible by 2, it is impossible
            }
            
            int gcdVal = __gcd(nums[i], nums[i + 1]);
            nums[i + 1] = gcdVal;
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        operations = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if nums[i] % 2 != 0:
                return -1  # If any number is not divisible by 2, it is impossible
            
            gcd_val = math.gcd(nums[i], nums[i + 1])
            nums[i + 1] = gcd_val
            operations += 1
        
        return operations
```
