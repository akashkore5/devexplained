## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to create a new function that wraps the original function `fn`. This new function should ensure that `fn` is called at most once. We can achieve this by keeping track of whether `fn` has been called before. If it has been called, we return `undefined`. Otherwise, we call `fn` and record the result.

Here is the algorithm:
1. Create a boolean variable `called` initialized to `false` to track if `fn` has been called.
2. Create a new function `onceFn` that takes the same arguments as `fn`.
3. Inside `onceFn`, check if `called` is `false`.
   - If `called` is `false`, call `fn` with the provided arguments and store the result.
     - Set `called` to `true`.
     - Return the result of calling `fn`.
   - If `called` is `true`, return `undefined`.

Time complexity: O(1) for each function call.
Space complexity: O(1).

:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.Function;

class Solution {
    public static Function<int[], Integer> once(Function<int[], Integer> fn) {
        boolean called = false;
        int result = 0;

        return (args) -> {
            if (!called) {
                result = fn.apply(args);
                called = true;
                return result;
            } else {
                return null;
            }
        };
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

std::function<int(int, int, int)> once(std::function<int(int, int, int)> fn) {
    bool called = false;
    int result = 0;

    return [&](int a, int b, int c) {
        if (!called) {
            result = fn(a, b, c);
            called = true;
            return result;
        } else {
            return -1; // returning -1 as undefined
        }
    };
}
```

```python
def once(fn):
    called = False
    result = 0

    def once_fn(*args):
        nonlocal called, result
        if not called:
            result = fn(*args)
            called = True
            return result
        else:
            return None

    return once_fn
```
