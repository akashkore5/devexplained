## Explanation:
To find the latest salaries from a given list of salaries, we can use a HashMap to store the latest salary for each employee. We iterate through the list of salaries and update the HashMap with the latest salary for each employee. Finally, we retrieve the latest salaries from the HashMap.

- Create a HashMap to store the latest salary for each employee.
- Iterate through the list of salaries.
- Update the HashMap with the latest salary for each employee.
- Retrieve the latest salaries from the HashMap.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of salaries in the input list.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the HashMap to store the latest salaries.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public Map<Integer, Integer> findLatestSalaries(List<List<Integer>> salaries) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> latestSalaries = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (List<Integer> salary : salaries) {
            int employeeId = salary.get(0);
            int employeeSalary = salary.get(1);
            
            latestSalaries.put(employeeId, employeeSalary);
        }
        
        return latestSalaries;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<int, int> findLatestSalaries(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& salaries) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> latestSalaries;
        
        for (const auto& salary : salaries) {
            int employeeId = salary[0];
            int employeeSalary = salary[1];
            
            latestSalaries[employeeId] = employeeSalary;
        }
        
        return latestSalaries;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findLatestSalaries(self, salaries: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, int]:
        latestSalaries = {}
        
        for salary in salaries:
            employeeId, employeeSalary = salary
            latestSalaries[employeeId] = employeeSalary
            
        return latestSalaries
```
