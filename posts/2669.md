## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the occurrences of each artist in a given Spotify ranking list. We can use a HashMap to keep track of the counts of each artist. We iterate through the list of artists, updating the count in the HashMap for each artist encountered. Finally, we return the HashMap with the counts.

- Initialize a HashMap to store the counts of each artist.
- Iterate through the list of artists:
  - If the artist is already in the HashMap, increment its count.
  - If the artist is not in the HashMap, add it with a count of 1.
- Return the HashMap with the counts.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of artists in the input list.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the HashMap to store the counts.

:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public Map<String, Integer> countArtistOccurrences(List<String> artists) {
        Map<String, Integer> artistCounts = new HashMap<>();

        for (String artist : artists) {
            artistCounts.put(artist, artistCounts.getOrDefault(artist, 0) + 1);
        }

        return artistCounts;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> countArtistOccurrences(std::vector<std::string>& artists) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> artistCounts;

        for (const std::string& artist : artists) {
            artistCounts[artist]++;
        }

        return artistCounts;
    }
};
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def count_artist_occurrences(self, artists: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:
        artist_counts = defaultdict(int)

        for artist in artists:
            artist_counts[artist] += 1

        return artist_counts
```
