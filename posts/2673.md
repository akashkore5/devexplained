### Explanation:
To make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal, we need to balance the costs in the tree. We can achieve this by iteratively adjusting the costs of parent nodes based on the costs of their children. The idea is to propagate the excess costs from children to their parents such that the total cost of each path from the root to a leaf becomes equal. We will perform a depth-first traversal of the tree while keeping track of the excess cost at each node.

**Algorithm**:
1. Perform a depth-first traversal of the tree from the root.
2. Calculate the excess cost for each child node by subtracting the average cost of its children from its own cost.
3. Propagate the excess cost to the parent node by adding the excess cost of its children.
4. Recursively repeat steps 2 and 3 for each child node.

**Time Complexity**:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

**Space Complexity**:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) for the recursive stack.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int n, int[] cost) {
        return dfs(0, 0, cost);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int idx, int depth, int[] cost) {
        if (idx >= cost.length) return 0;
        
        int left = dfs(2 * idx + 1, depth + 1, cost);
        int right = dfs(2 * idx + 2, depth + 1, cost);
        
        int totalCost = left + right + cost[idx];
        
        if (depth > 0) {
            int excess = totalCost - cost[idx];
            cost[idx] += excess;
            return excess;
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cost) {
        return dfs(0, 0, cost);
    }
    
    int dfs(int idx, int depth, vector<int>& cost) {
        if (idx >= cost.size()) return 0;
        
        int left = dfs(2 * idx + 1, depth + 1, cost);
        int right = dfs(2 * idx + 2, depth + 1, cost);
        
        int totalCost = left + right + cost[idx];
        
        if (depth > 0) {
            int excess = totalCost - cost[idx];
            cost[idx] += excess;
            return excess;
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, n: int, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        def dfs(idx, depth):
            if idx >= len(cost):
                return 0
            
            left = dfs(2 * idx + 1, depth + 1)
            right = dfs(2 * idx + 2, depth + 1)
            
            total_cost = left + right + cost[idx]
            
            if depth > 0:
                excess = total_cost - cost[idx]
                cost[idx] += excess
                return excess
            
            return total_cost
        
        return dfs(0, 0)
