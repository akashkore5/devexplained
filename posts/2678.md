### Explanation:
1. Iterate through the array of details.
2. Extract the age information from each element.
3. Check if the age is strictly greater than 60.
4. Increment a counter for each passenger who is over 60.
5. Return the total count of senior citizens.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the details array.  
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSeniorCitizens(String[] details) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String detail : details) {
            int age = Integer.parseInt(detail.substring(11, 13));
            if (age > 60) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSeniorCitizens(vector<string>& details) {
        int count = 0;
        for (string detail : details) {
            int age = stoi(detail.substr(11, 2));
            if (age > 60) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numSeniorCitizens(self, details: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for detail in details:
            age = int(detail[11:13])
            if age > 60:
                count += 1
        return count
```
