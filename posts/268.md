## Explanation:

To find the missing number in the array, we can utilize the property of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. By calculating the expected sum of numbers in the range `[0, n]` and subtracting the sum of the elements in the array, we can find the missing number.

### Algorithm:
1. Calculate the expected sum of numbers in the range `[0, n]` using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
2. Calculate the actual sum of elements in the array.
3. Subtract the actual sum from the expected sum to find the missing number.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) since we iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            actualSum += num;
        }
        
        return expectedSum - actualSum;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            actualSum += num;
        }
        
        return expectedSum - actualSum;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        actual_sum = sum(nums)
        
        return expected_sum - actual_sum
```
