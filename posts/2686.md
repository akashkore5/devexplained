### Explanation:

Given a list of food delivery times and the time it takes for the courier to reach the recipient, we need to find the time that the last order can be delivered immediately.

To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the minimum possible time that can satisfy all delivery requests. We will maintain a time window and check if it is possible to deliver all orders within that time. If it is possible, we update the answer and narrow down the time window. If it is not possible, we widen the time window.
 Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeliveryTime(int[] deliveryTimes, int time) {
        int left = 0, right = 1000000;
        int ans = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < deliveryTimes.length; i++) {
                cnt += Math.max(0, mid - deliveryTimes[i]);
            }
            if (cnt <= time) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### C++ Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeliveryTime(vector<int>& deliveryTimes, int time) {
        int left = 0, right = 1000000;
        int ans = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < deliveryTimes.size(); i++) {
                cnt += max(0, mid - deliveryTimes[i]);
            }
            if (cnt <= time) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minDeliveryTime(self, deliveryTimes: List[int], time: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, 1000000
        ans = 0
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            cnt = 0
            for i in range(len(deliveryTimes)):
                cnt += max(0, mid - deliveryTimes[i])
            if cnt <= time:
                ans = mid
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return ans
```
