### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the last time a bike was used given the start and end time of each bike's rides. We can achieve this by iterating through the rides and storing the last time each bike was used in a HashMap. Finally, we return the HashMap with the last time each bike was used.

- Create a HashMap to store the last time each bike was used.
- Iterate through the rides and update the last time each bike was used.
- Return the HashMap with the last time each bike was used.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of rides
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the last time each bike was used
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public Map<Integer, Integer> lastTimeUsed(int[][] rides) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> lastUsed = new HashMap<>();

        for (int[] ride : rides) {
            int bikeId = ride[0];
            int endTime = ride[1];
            lastUsed.put(bikeId, Math.max(lastUsed.getOrDefault(bikeId, -1), endTime));
        }

        return lastUsed;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<int, int> lastTimeUsed(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& rides) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> lastUsed;

        for (const auto& ride : rides) {
            int bikeId = ride[0];
            int endTime = ride[1];
            lastUsed[bikeId] = std::max(lastUsed[bikeId], endTime);
        }

        return lastUsed;
    }
};
```

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def lastTimeUsed(self, rides: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
        last_used = defaultdict(int)

        for ride in rides:
            bike_id, end_time = ride
            last_used[bike_id] = max(last_used[bike_id], end_time)

        return last_used
```
