## Explanation:
To create an infinite method object, we can use a class with a method that returns a new instance of the same class. This can be achieved by having a constructor that sets the necessary parameters and a method that creates a new instance with updated parameters.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a class `InfiniteMethodObject` with a constructor that initializes parameters.
2. Add a method `next` that creates a new instance of the `InfiniteMethodObject` class with updated parameters.
3. Repeat the process as needed to create an "infinite" chain of method calls.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of creating a new instance with updated parameters is O(1) since it involves simple assignment operations.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input.

:

```java
class InfiniteMethodObject {
    private int value;
    
    public InfiniteMethodObject(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    public InfiniteMethodObject next(int newValue) {
        return new InfiniteMethodObject(newValue);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class InfiniteMethodObject {
private:
    int value;
public:
    InfiniteMethodObject(int value) : value(value) {}
    
    InfiniteMethodObject next(int newValue) {
        return InfiniteMethodObject(newValue);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class InfiniteMethodObject:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def next(self, new_value):
        return InfiniteMethodObject(new_value)
```
