## Explanation:

To make an object immutable, we need to ensure that its state cannot be changed after it has been instantiated. This can be achieved by following these steps:
1. Declare the class as final so that it cannot be subclassed.
2. Make all fields private and final so that they cannot be modified.
3. Do not provide any setter methods to modify the state of the object.
4. If the fields are mutable objects, make sure to return defensive copies in getter methods to prevent external modification.

By following these steps, we can ensure that the object's state remains constant once it is created.

Time Complexity: O(1) for accessing fields, as the fields are private and accessed directly.
Space Complexity: O(1) for storing the fields, as they are part of the object.

:

```java
final class ImmutableObject {
    private final int value;

    public ImmutableObject(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class ImmutableObject {
private:
    const int value;

public:
    ImmutableObject(int value) : value(value) {}

    int getValue() const {
        return value;
    }
};
```

```python
class ImmutableObject:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value
```
