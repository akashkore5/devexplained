### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of transactions and keep track of consecutive transactions with increasing amounts. We will maintain a counter to track the current consecutive count and update the maximum consecutive count whenever we encounter a new increasing transaction. We can then return the maximum consecutive count.

- Initialize variables `maxConsecutive` and `consecutive` to 1.
- Iterate through the transactions starting from index 1:
  - If the current transaction amount is greater than the previous transaction amount, increment `consecutive` and update `maxConsecutive` if `consecutive` is greater.
  - Otherwise, reset `consecutive` to 1.
- Return `maxConsecutive` as the result.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutive(int[] transactions) {
        int maxConsecutive = 1;
        int consecutive = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < transactions.length; i++) {
            if (transactions[i] > transactions[i - 1]) {
                consecutive++;
                maxConsecutive = Math.max(maxConsecutive, consecutive);
            } else {
                consecutive = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return maxConsecutive;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxConsecutive(vector<int>& transactions) {
        int maxConsecutive = 1;
        int consecutive = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < transactions.size(); i++) {
            if (transactions[i] > transactions[i - 1]) {
                consecutive++;
                maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, consecutive);
            } else {
                consecutive = 1;
            }
        }
        
        return maxConsecutive;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxConsecutive(self, transactions: List[int]) -> int:
        maxConsecutive = 1
        consecutive = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(transactions)):
            if transactions[i] > transactions[i - 1]:
                consecutive += 1
                maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, consecutive)
            else:
                consecutive = 1
        
        return maxConsecutive
```
