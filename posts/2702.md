### Explanation:

Given an array of integers, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers non-positive. The operation allowed is to choose any element in the array and decrement it by 1.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the number of operations needed to make each element non-positive. If the element is already non-positive, we move on to the next element. If the element is positive, we calculate the number of operations needed to make it non-positive and add it to our total count of operations.
:
```java
public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 0) {
            count += num;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 0) {
            count += num;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Python:
```python
def minOperations(nums):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 0:
            count += num
    return count
```
