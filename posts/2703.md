### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we simply need to return the count of arguments passed to the function. This can be achieved by accessing the length of the arguments array.

- Algorithm:
  1. Get the length of the arguments array.
  2. Return the length as the result.

- Time Complexity: O(1) as accessing the length of an array is a constant-time operation.
- Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

:

```java
public int argumentsLength(Object... args) {
    return args.length;
}
```

```cpp
int argumentsLength(std::initializer_list<Object> args) {
    return args.size();
}
```

```python
def arguments_length(*args):
    return len(args)
```
