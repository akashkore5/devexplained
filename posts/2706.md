### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the prices array and for each price, calculate the remaining amount of money after buying that chocolate. We need to find two chocolates that minimize the sum of their prices while ensuring that we have non-negative leftover money.

We can achieve this by using a nested loop to try all possible pairs of chocolates. For each pair, we calculate the total cost and update the minimum leftover money if the total cost is less than the current minimum. If we find a pair that allows us to buy two chocolates without going into debt, we update the minimum leftover money accordingly.

Finally, we return the minimum leftover money after trying all possible pairs of chocolates.

- Time complexity: O(N^2) where N is the number of chocolates (prices array length).
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int buyTwoChocolates(int[] prices, int money) {
        int minLeftover = money;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                int totalCost = prices[i] + prices[j];
                int leftover = money - totalCost;
                if (leftover >= 0 && leftover < minLeftover) {
                    minLeftover = leftover;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minLeftover;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int buyTwoChocolates(vector<int>& prices, int money) {
        int minLeftover = money;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.size(); j++) {
                int totalCost = prices[i] + prices[j];
                int leftover = money - totalCost;
                if (leftover >= 0 && leftover < minLeftover) {
                    minLeftover = leftover;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minLeftover;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def buyTwoChocolates(self, prices: List[int], money: int) -> int:
        min_leftover = money
        
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                total_cost = prices[i] + prices[j]
                leftover = money - total_cost
                if leftover >= 0 and leftover < min_leftover:
                    min_leftover = leftover
        
        return min_leftover
