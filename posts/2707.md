## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate over the input string `s` and keep track of the minimum number of extra characters left over up to each index. At each index, we will check all possible substrings starting from that index and ending at a point where a word in the dictionary ends. We update the minimum number of extra characters left over at each index based on the minimum of the current value and the value obtained by considering the current substring.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `s.length() + 1` to store the minimum number of extra characters left over up to each index.
2. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0, as there are no extra characters at the beginning.
3. Iterate over each index `i` from 0 to `s.length()`.
4. For each index `i`, iterate over each word in the dictionary.
5. If the substring starting at index `i` can form the current word, update `dp[i + word.length()]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i] + (i + word.length() - i - word.length())`, which represents the number of extra characters left over after using the current word.
6. At the end, return `dp[s.length()]`, which represents the minimum number of extra characters left over after breaking up the string optimally.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where n is the length of the input string `s` and m is the total number of characters in the dictionary.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minExtraCharacters(String s, String[] dictionary) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (String word : dictionary) {
                if (i + word.length() <= n && s.substring(i, i + word.length()).equals(word)) {
                    dp[i + word.length()] = Math.min(dp[i + word.length()], dp[i] + (i + word.length() - i - word.length()));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minExtraCharacters(string s, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (string word : dictionary) {
                if (i + word.size() <= n && s.substr(i, word.size()) == word) {
                    dp[i + word.size()] = min(dp[i + word.size()], dp[i] + (i + word.size() - i - word.size()));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minExtraCharacters(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for word in dictionary:
                if i + len(word) <= n and s[i:i + len(word)] == word:
                    dp[i + len(word)] = min(dp[i + len(word)], dp[i] + (i + len(word) - i - len(word)))
        return dp[n]
