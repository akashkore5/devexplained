### Explanation
To find the maximum strength of a group, we need to consider all possible groups of students and calculate their strength. We can achieve this by iterating through all possible subsets of the input array `nums` and calculating the product of elements in each subset. The maximum of these products will be the maximum strength of the group.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `maxStrength` to store the maximum strength found.
2. Use a bitmask to iterate through all possible subsets of `nums`.
3. For each subset represented by the current bitmask, calculate the product of elements in that subset.
4. Update `maxStrength` if the calculated product is greater than the current maximum.
5. Return `maxStrength` as the maximum strength of the group.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n * n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxGroupStrength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int maxStrength = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            int product = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    product *= nums[i];
                }
            }
            maxStrength = Math.max(maxStrength, product);
        }
        
        return maxStrength;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxGroupStrength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int maxStrength = INT_MIN;
        
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            int product = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    product *= nums[i];
                }
            }
            maxStrength = max(maxStrength, product);
        }
        
        return maxStrength;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxGroupStrength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        maxStrength = float('-inf')
        
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            product = 1
            for i in range(n):
                if (mask & (1 << i)) != 0:
                    product *= nums[i]
            maxStrength = max(maxStrength, product)
        
        return maxStrength
```
