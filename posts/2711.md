### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each cell of the given grid and calculate the number of distinct values on the diagonals to the left and above the cell (leftAbove) and on the diagonals to the right and below the cell (rightBelow). We then compute the absolute difference between these two values to get the answer for each cell.

1. Create a new matrix `answer` of the same size as the input grid.
2. For each cell in the grid:
   - Calculate the distinct values on the left-above diagonal (leftAbove) and right-below diagonal (rightBelow).
   - Compute the absolute difference between leftAbove and rightBelow to get the answer for that cell.
3. Return the `answer` matrix.

Time Complexity: O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
Space Complexity: O(m*n) for the answer matrix.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] diagonalDifference(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] answer = new int[m][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                Set<Integer> leftAbove = new HashSet<>();
                Set<Integer> rightBelow = new HashSet<>();
                
                int r = i - 1, c = j - 1;
                while (r >= 0 && c >= 0) {
                    leftAbove.add(grid[r][c]);
                    r--;
                    c--;
                }
                
                r = i + 1;
                c = j + 1;
                while (r < m && c < n) {
                    rightBelow.add(grid[r][c]);
                    r++;
                    c++;
                }
                
                answer[i][j] = Math.abs(leftAbove.size() - rightBelow.size());
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
