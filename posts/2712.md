## Explanation:
To find the minimum cost to make all characters equal in the given binary string, we can try to minimize the cost by making all characters the same. We can iterate through the string, calculating the cost of flipping all characters before the current index and all characters after the current index. The minimum cost would be the minimum of all these calculated costs.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize the total cost to 0.
2. Iterate through the string and calculate the cost of flipping all characters before the current index and after the current index.
3. Keep track of the minimum cost found.
4. Return the minimum cost as the answer.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the input binary string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a few variables to store the minimum cost and the total cost.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int totalCost = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int costBefore = 0;
            int costAfter = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(j) != s.charAt(i)) {
                    costBefore++;
                }
            }
            
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(j) != s.charAt(i)) {
                    costAfter++;
                }
            }
            
            totalCost = Math.min(totalCost, Math.min(i + 1 + costAfter, n - i + costBefore));
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int totalCost = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int costBefore = 0;
            int costAfter = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (s[j] != s[i]) {
                    costBefore++;
                }
            }
            
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (s[j] != s[i]) {
                    costAfter++;
                }
            }
            
            totalCost = min(totalCost, min(i + 1 + costAfter, n - i + costBefore));
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        total_cost = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            cost_before = 0
            cost_after = 0
            
            for j in range(i):
                if s[j] != s[i]:
                    cost_before += 1
            
            for j in range(i, n):
                if s[j] != s[i]:
                    cost_after += 1
            
            total_cost = min(total_cost, min(i + 1 + cost_after, n - i + cost_before))
        
        return total_cost
