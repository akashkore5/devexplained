## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm with a slight modification to track the number of hops as well. We maintain a priority queue to explore the nodes with the shortest distance and hops first. We keep track of the number of hops made so far while exploring the nodes. Whenever we reach the destination node within the specified number of hops (k), we return the shortest distance to that node.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a priority queue to store the nodes with their distance and number of hops.
2. Add the source node to the priority queue with distance 0 and hops 0.
3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Pop the node with the smallest distance and hops from the priority queue.
   - If this node is the destination node and the number of hops is less than or equal to k, return the distance.
   - Explore the neighbors of the current node and update their distance and hops in the priority queue if it results in a shorter path.
4. If the destination node is not reached within k hops, return -1.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O((V + E) * log(V)), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V) for the priority queue and O(V) for the graph representation.

class Solution {
    public int findShortestPath(int[][] graph, int src, int dst, int k) {
        int n = graph.length;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        pq.offer(new int[]{0, src, 0});

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int distance = curr[0];
            int node = curr[1];
            int hops = curr[2];

            if (node == dst && hops <= k) {
                return distance;
            }

            if (hops > k) {
                continue;
            }

            for (int[] neighbor : graph[node]) {
                int nextNode = neighbor[0];
                int edgeWeight = neighbor[1];
                pq.offer(new int[]{distance + edgeWeight, nextNode, hops + 1});
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findShortestPath(vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph, int src, int dst, int k) {
        int n = graph.size();
        priority_queue<tuple<int, int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, greater<tuple<int, int, int>>> pq;
        pq.push({0, src, 0});

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [distance, node, hops] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            if (node == dst && hops <= k) {
                return distance;
            }

            if (hops > k) {
                continue;
            }

            for (auto neighbor : graph[node]) {
                int nextNode = neighbor.first;
                int edgeWeight = neighbor.second;
                pq.push({distance + edgeWeight, nextNode, hops + 1});
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findShortestPath(self, graph, src, dst, k):
        n = len(graph)
        pq = [(0, src, 0)]

        while pq:
            distance, node, hops = heapq.heappop(pq)

            if node == dst and hops <= k:
                return distance

            if hops > k:
                continue

            for next_node, edge_weight in graph[node]:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance + edge_weight, next_node, hops + 1))

        return -1
