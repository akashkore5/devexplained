## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given permutation array `nums` and count the number of misplaced elements. A misplaced element is any element that is not at its correct position in a semi-ordered permutation. The number of operations needed would be equal to the number of misplaced elements. We can determine if an element is misplaced by checking if it should be at index `i` or `i+1` based on the values 1 to n. 

- Initialize a variable `misplaced` to 0.
- Iterate through the array `nums`.
- For each element at index `i`, check if it is not equal to `i+1` (since the permutation should start from 1 to n).
- If the element is misplaced, increment the `misplaced` count.
- Finally, return the `misplaced` count as the minimum number of operations needed.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input permutation array, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int misplaced = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) {
                misplaced++;
            }
        }
        return misplaced;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int misplaced = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) {
                misplaced++;
            }
        }
        return misplaced;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        misplaced = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                misplaced += 1
        return misplaced
```
