## Explanation
We need to create a new promise that resolves with the sum of the values resolved by `promise1` and `promise2`. We can achieve this by creating a new promise that chains the resolutions of `promise1` and `promise2`, then calculates the sum and resolves with the result.

- Create a new promise that chains the resolutions of `promise1` and `promise2`.
- Once both promises have resolved, calculate the sum of the two values.
- Resolve the new promise with the sum.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is dependent on the time taken by `promise1` and `promise2` to resolve.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is constant O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class Solution {
    public CompletableFuture<Integer> addTwoPromises(CompletableFuture<Integer> promise1, CompletableFuture<Integer> promise2) {
        return promise1.thenCombine(promise2, Integer::sum);
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <future>

class Solution {
public:
    std::future<int> addTwoPromises(std::future<int>& promise1, std::future<int>& promise2) {
        return std::async(std::launch::deferred, [&promise1, &promise2]() {
            return promise1.get() + promise2.get();
        });
    }
};
```

```python
import asyncio

class Solution:
    async def add_two_promises(self, promise1, promise2):
        value1 = await promise1
        value2 = await promise2
        return value1 + value2
```
