### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Given the number of houses `n` in a circular street, we need to count the number of houses that are not adjacent to each other.

The total number of ways to choose two non-adjacent houses is calculated as `n - GCD(n, 2)`, where `GCD(n, 2)` represents the greatest common divisor of `n` and `2`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countHouses(int n) {
        return n - gcd(n, 2);
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    }
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int countHouses(int n) {
    return n - gcd(n, 2);
}

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    cout << countHouses(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)

def count_houses(n):
    return n - gcd(n, 2)

n = 10
print(count_houses(n))
```
