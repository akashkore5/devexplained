companyTags: "Unknown"
slug: "lexicographically-smallest-string-after-substring-operation"

### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate over the input string `s` from left to right. For each character, we can compute the distance to the character 'a' and the character 'z'. We then take the minimum of these distances and modify the character accordingly to get the lexicographically smallest string after the substring operation.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the final modified string.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string `s`.
3. For each character, compute the distance to 'a' and 'z'.
4. Modify the character based on the minimum distance.
5. Append the modified character to the `result` string.
6. Return the final `result` string.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the final modified string.

```java
class Solution {
    public String findLexSmallestString(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int distToA = c - 'a';
            int distToZ = 'z' - c + 1;
            char modified = distToA <= distToZ ? (char)('a' + distToA) : (char)('a' + distToZ);
            result.append(modified);
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLexSmallestString(string s) {
        string result = "";
        
        for (char c : s) {
            int distToA = c - 'a';
            int distToZ = 'z' - c + 1;
            char modified = distToA <= distToZ ? 'a' + distToA : 'a' + distToZ;
            result += modified;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findLexSmallestString(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = ""
        
        for c in s:
            dist_to_a = ord(c) - ord('a')
            dist_to_z = ord('z') - ord(c) + 1
            modified = chr(ord('a') + dist_to_a) if dist_to_a <= dist_to_z else chr(ord('a') + dist_to_z)
            result += modified
        
        return result
