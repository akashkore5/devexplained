## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types by performing operations that change the types of chocolates. The key observation is that we can represent the problem as a cyclic graph where each node represents a type of chocolate and each edge represents the operation of changing the type of chocolate.

We can start by considering the case where we don't perform any operations. In this case, the cost would be the sum of all the costs of collecting chocolates individually. However, by performing operations, we can potentially reduce the total cost by moving to different types of chocolates with lower costs.

To find the minimum cost, we can iterate through each type of chocolate and calculate the cost of collecting chocolates starting from that type. We can then choose the minimum cost among all starting types.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of chocolates.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int cost = 0;
            int j = i;
            while (true) {
                cost += nums[j];
                if (j == (i + 1) % n) {
                    break;
                }
                j = (j + 1) % n;
            }
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, cost + (n - 1) * x);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int minCost = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int cost = 0;
            int j = i;
            while (true) {
                cost += nums[j];
                if (j == (i + 1) % n) {
                    break;
                }
                j = (j + 1) % n;
            }
            minCost = min(minCost, cost + (n - 1) * x);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        minCost = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            cost = 0
            j = i
            while True:
                cost += nums[j]
                if j == (i + 1) % n:
                    break
                j = (j + 1) % n
            minCost = min(minCost, cost + (n - 1) * x)
        
        return minCost
