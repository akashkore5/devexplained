## Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the node in a graph that is marked as true and is closest to a given query node. We can solve this problem by performing a Breadth First Search (BFS) from the query node to find the closest marked node.

### Algorithm:
1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. Perform BFS starting from the query node.
3. Keep track of the distance from the query node to each node visited during BFS.
4. Whenever we encounter a marked node during BFS, return that node as the closest marked node.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V), where V is the number of nodes in the graph.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findClosestNode(int n, int[][] edges, boolean[] marked, int query) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(query);
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        visited[query] = true;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int curr = queue.poll();
                if (marked[curr]) {
                    return curr;
                }
                for (int neighbor : graph.get(curr)) {
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        visited[neighbor] = true;
                        queue.offer(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosestNode(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<bool>& marked, int query) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        for (auto edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(query);
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        visited[query] = true;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int curr = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (marked[curr]) {
                    return curr;
                }
                for (int neighbor : graph[curr]) {
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        visited[neighbor] = true;
                        q.push(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def findClosestNode(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], marked: List[bool], query: int) -> int:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for edge in edges:
            graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
            graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
        queue = deque([query])
        visited = [False] * n
        visited[query] = True
        
        while queue:
            size = len(queue)
            for _ in range(size):
                curr = queue.popleft()
                if marked[curr]:
                    return curr
                for neighbor in graph[curr]:
                    if not visited[neighbor]:
                        visited[neighbor] = True
                        queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return -1
