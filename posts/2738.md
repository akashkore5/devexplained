### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input text and count the occurrences of each word. We can use a hashmap to store the count of each word. We will split the text into words using whitespace as a delimiter. Before counting the occurrences, we can normalize the words by converting them to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive counting.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty hashmap to store word counts.
2. Split the input text into words using whitespace as a delimiter.
3. Normalize each word by converting it to lowercase.
4. Iterate through each word:
     - If the word is already in the hashmap, increment its count.
     - If the word is not in the hashmap, add it with a count of 1.
5. Return the hashmap containing word counts.

### Time Complexity
- We iterate through each word in the input text once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words in the text.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique words in the text (worst-case scenario).
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public Map<String, Integer> countOccurrences(String text) {
        Map<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        String[] words = text.split("\\s+");
        
        for (String word : words) {
            word = word.toLowerCase();
            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return wordCount;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> countOccurrences(std::string text) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> wordCount;
        std::istringstream iss(text);
        std::string word;
        
        while (iss >> word) {
            for (char& c : word) {
                c = std::tolower(c);
            }
            wordCount[word]++;
        }
        
        return wordCount;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def count_occurrences(self, text: str) -> dict:
        word_count = {}
        
        words = text.split()
        
        for word in words:
            word = word.lower()
            word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1
        
        return word_count
```
