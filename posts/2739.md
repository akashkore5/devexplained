### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of fuel consumption and fuel injection from the additional tank to the main tank whenever 5 liters of fuel are consumed from the main tank. We keep track of the total distance traveled and return the maximum distance that can be traveled.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize variables `distance` to 0, `mainFuel` to `mainTank`, `additionalFuel` to `additionalTank`.
2. While `mainFuel` is greater than 0:
   - Increment `distance` by 10 km (since mileage is 10 km per liter).
   - Decrement `mainFuel` by 1.
   - If `mainFuel` becomes 0, check if `additionalFuel` is greater than 0:
     - If yes, transfer 1 liter of fuel from `additionalFuel` to `mainFuel`.
     - Reset `mainFuel` to 1.
     - Decrement `additionalFuel` by 1.
3. Return the `distance` as the maximum distance traveled.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(max(mainTank, additionalTank)) since we iterate through the fuel consumption process.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int mainTank, int additionalTank) {
        int distance = 0;
        int mainFuel = mainTank;
        int additionalFuel = additionalTank;
        
        while (mainFuel > 0) {
            distance += 10;
            mainFuel--;
            if (mainFuel == 0 && additionalFuel > 0) {
                mainFuel = 1;
                additionalFuel--;
            }
        }
        
        return distance;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(int mainTank, int additionalTank) {
        int distance = 0;
        int mainFuel = mainTank;
        int additionalFuel = additionalTank;
        
        while (mainFuel > 0) {
            distance += 10;
            mainFuel--;
            if (mainFuel == 0 && additionalFuel > 0) {
                mainFuel = 1;
                additionalFuel--;
            }
        }
        
        return distance;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:
        distance = 0
        mainFuel = mainTank
        additionalFuel = additionalTank
        
        while mainFuel > 0:
            distance += 10
            mainFuel -= 1
            if mainFuel == 0 and additionalFuel > 0:
                mainFuel = 1
                additionalFuel -= 1
        
        return distance
```
