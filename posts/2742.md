### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost required to paint the walls. We can maintain two dp arrays: one for the cost of painting the walls when the free painter is used and one when the paid painter is used. We iterate through the walls and update the dp arrays based on whether it is more optimal to use the free painter or the paid painter for each wall.

1. Initialize two dp arrays, `dpPaid` and `dpFree`, of size `n+1`.
2. Set `dpPaid[0] = 0` and `dpFree[0] = 0` as the base cases.
3. Iterate through each wall from 1 to n:
   - For each wall `i`, update `dpPaid[i]` and `dpFree[i]` based on the minimum cost of painting the wall using the paid painter or the free painter.
4. The minimum cost to paint all walls will be the minimum value between `dpPaid[n]` and `dpFree[n]`.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of walls.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the dp arrays.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] cost, int[] time) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[] dpPaid = new int[n+1];
        int[] dpFree = new int[n+1];
        
        dpPaid[0] = 0;
        dpFree[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dpPaid[i] = Math.min(dpPaid[i-1] + cost[i-1], dpFree[i-1] + cost[i-1]);
            dpFree[i] = Math.min(dpPaid[i-1], dpFree[i-1]) + time[i-1];
        }
        
        return Math.min(dpPaid[n], dpFree[n]);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& cost, vector<int>& time) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<int> dpPaid(n+1);
        vector<int> dpFree(n+1);
        
        dpPaid[0] = 0;
        dpFree[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dpPaid[i] = min(dpPaid[i-1] + cost[i-1], dpFree[i-1] + cost[i-1]);
            dpFree[i] = min(dpPaid[i-1], dpFree[i-1]) + time[i-1];
        }
        
        return min(dpPaid[n], dpFree[n]);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, cost: List[int], time: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(cost)
        dpPaid = [0] * (n+1)
        dpFree = [0] * (n+1)
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dpPaid[i] = min(dpPaid[i-1] + cost[i-1], dpFree[i-1] + cost[i-1])
            dpFree[i] = min(dpPaid[i-1], dpFree[i-1]) + time[i-1]
        
        return min(dpPaid[n], dpFree[n])
