## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to iterate through the given string. We will keep track of the characters we have seen so far in a set. Whenever we encounter a repeating character while expanding the window, we will shrink the window from the left until the repeating character is no longer in the window.

At each step, we will count the number of substrings that can be formed considering the current window, and add it to the total count. The total count will be the answer to the problem.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize variables: `start` = 0, `end` = 0, `count` = 0, `seen` set to store seen characters.
2. Iterate `end` over the string:
   - If the current character at `end` is not in `seen`, add it to `seen`.
   - If the current character at `end` is in `seen`, increment `start` until the current character is no longer in `seen`.
   - Add the number of substrings that can be formed with the current window size to `count`.
3. Return the final `count`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
**Space Complexity:** O(min(n, 26)) as the maximum size of the set `seen` can be at most 26 (all lowercase letters).
```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        Set<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            char c = s.charAt(end);
            while (seen.contains(c)) {
                seen.remove(s.charAt(start));
                start++;
            }
            seen.add(c);
            count += (end - start + 1);
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        unordered_set<char> seen;
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            char c = s[end];
            while (seen.count(c) > 0) {
                seen.erase(s[start]);
                start++;
            }
            seen.insert(c);
            count += (end - start + 1);
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        count = 0
        seen = set()
        start = 0

        for end in range(n):
            c = s[end]
            while c in seen:
                seen.remove(s[start])
                start += 1
            seen.add(c)
            count += (end - start + 1)

        return count
```
