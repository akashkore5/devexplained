### Explanation:
To construct the longest new string without having "AAA" or "BBB" as a substring, we need to carefully choose the order in which we concatenate the given strings. The key idea is to always alternate between the "AB" strings and the "A" or "B" strings. This way, we can avoid creating substrings "AAA" or "BBB".

We can start by concatenating the "AB" strings and then interleave the "A" and "B" strings to maximize the length of the final string. If we have more "A" or "B" strings, we can add them at the end.

```java
class Solution {
    public int constructMaxLength(int x, int y, int z) {
        int countAB = Math.min(x, y);
        int maxLen = countAB * 2 + z;
        if (x > countAB) {
            x -= countAB;
            maxLen += Math.min(x, z) * 2;
        } else if (y > countAB) {
            y -= countAB;
            maxLen += Math.min(y, z) * 2;
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int constructMaxLength(int x, int y, int z) {
        int countAB = min(x, y);
        int maxLen = countAB * 2 + z;
        if (x > countAB) {
            x -= countAB;
            maxLen += min(x, z) * 2;
        } else if (y > countAB) {
            y -= countAB;
            maxLen += min(y, z) * 2;
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def construct_max_length(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
        count_AB = min(x, y)
        max_len = count_AB * 2 + z
        if x > count_AB:
            x -= count_AB
            max_len += min(x, z) * 2
        elif y > count_AB:
            y -= count_AB
            max_len += min(y, z) * 2
        return max_len
```
