## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible values of `i` in the range [0, 60] and calculate the result of subtracting `2^i + num2` from `num1`. We keep track of the minimum number of operations needed to make `num1` equal to 0. If it is not possible to make `num1` equal to 0, we return -1.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize a variable `operations` to keep track of the minimum number of operations needed.
  2. Iterate through all possible values of `i` from 0 to 60.
  3. Calculate the result of subtracting `2^i + num2` from `num1`.
  4. If the result is 0, update `operations` to the current number of operations.
  5. Return the minimum number of operations if it is not equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE, otherwise return -1.

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) as we are iterating through a constant range [0, 60].
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= 60; i++) {
            long curr = (long) num1 - (1L << i) * num2;
            if (curr == 0) {
                operations = Math.min(operations, i + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return (operations != Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? operations : -1;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= 60; i++) {
            long long curr = (long long) num1 - (1LL << i) * num2;
            if (curr == 0) {
                operations = min(operations, i + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return (operations != INT_MAX) ? operations : -1;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        operations = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(61):
            curr = num1 - (1 << i) * num2
            if curr == 0:
                operations = min(operations, i + 1)
        
        return operations if operations != float('inf') else -1
```
