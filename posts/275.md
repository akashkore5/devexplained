### Explanation
To solve this problem in logarithmic time, we can use binary search. We will search for the h-index value within the range of 0 to n, where n is the total number of papers. We can adjust the range based on the citations received for each paper. If the number of papers with citations greater than or equal to a certain value is greater than or equal to that value, we update our h-index candidate. We continue this process until we find the maximum h-index value.

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) where n is the number of papers.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] == n - mid) {
                return n - mid;
            } else if (citations[mid] < n - mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return n - left;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] == n - mid) {
                return n - mid;
            } else if (citations[mid] < n - mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return n - left;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if citations[mid] == n - mid:
                return n - mid
            elif citations[mid] < n - mid:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
                
        return n - left
```
