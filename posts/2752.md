## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of transactions and keep track of the consecutive transactions for each customer. We can use a HashMap to store the count of consecutive transactions for each customer. After iterating through all transactions, we can then find the customer(s) with the maximum number of consecutive transactions.

Here are the steps:
1. Create a HashMap to store the count of consecutive transactions for each customer.
2. Iterate through the list of transactions and update the count of consecutive transactions for each customer.
3. Find the customer(s) with the maximum number of consecutive transactions.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of transactions.
Space complexity: O(n) for the HashMap to store the count of consecutive transactions for each customer.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getMaxCustomers(int[] transactions) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> consecutiveTransactions = new HashMap<>();
        int maxConsecutive = 0;
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < transactions.length; i++) {
            int customer = transactions[i];
            consecutiveTransactions.put(customer, consecutiveTransactions.getOrDefault(customer, 0) + 1);
            maxConsecutive = Math.max(maxConsecutive, consecutiveTransactions.get(customer));

            if (i - start + 1 - maxConsecutive > 1) {
                consecutiveTransactions.put(transactions[start], consecutiveTransactions.get(transactions[start]) - 1);
                start++;
            }
        }

        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : consecutiveTransactions.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == maxConsecutive) {
                result.add(entry.getKey());
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getMaxCustomers(vector<int>& transactions) {
        unordered_map<int, int> consecutiveTransactions;
        int maxConsecutive = 0;
        vector<int> result;

        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < transactions.size(); i++) {
            int customer = transactions[i];
            consecutiveTransactions[customer]++;
            maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, consecutiveTransactions[customer]);

            if (i - start + 1 - maxConsecutive > 1) {
                consecutiveTransactions[transactions[start]]--;
                start++;
            }
        }

        for (auto entry : consecutiveTransactions) {
            if (entry.second == maxConsecutive) {
                result.push_back(entry.first);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxCustomers(self, transactions: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        consecutiveTransactions = {}
        maxConsecutive = 0
        result = []

        start = 0
        for i in range(len(transactions)):
            customer = transactions[i]
            consecutiveTransactions[customer] = consecutiveTransactions.get(customer, 0) + 1
            maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, consecutiveTransactions[customer])

            if i - start + 1 - maxConsecutive > 1:
                consecutiveTransactions[transactions[start]] -= 1
                start += 1

        for customer, count in consecutiveTransactions.items():
            if count == maxConsecutive:
                result.append(customer)

        return result
```
