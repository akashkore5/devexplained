## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each house and for each house, we calculate the distance to its nearest neighbor on the right and on the left. We then find the minimum of these two distances to determine the minimum distance to the nearest neighbor for each house. Finally, we count the number of houses that have a minimum distance greater than or equal to a given threshold.

- Start by calculating the distances from each house to its neighbors
- Find the minimum distance on the right and left for each house
- Count the number of houses with a minimum distance greater than or equal to the threshold

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of houses
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the distances
```java
class Solution {
    public int countHouses(int[] houses, int threshold) {
        int n = houses.length;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minDist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    int dist = Math.min(Math.abs(houses[i] - houses[j]), n - Math.abs(houses[i] - houses[j]));
                    minDist = Math.min(minDist, dist);
                }
            }
            
            if (minDist >= threshold) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int countHouses(std::vector<int>& houses, int threshold) {
        int n = houses.size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minDist = INT_MAX;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    int dist = std::min(std::abs(houses[i] - houses[j]), n - std::abs(houses[i] - houses[j]));
                    minDist = std::min(minDist, dist);
                }
            }
            
            if (minDist >= threshold) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countHouses(self, houses: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        n = len(houses)
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            minDist = float('inf')
            
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j:
                    dist = min(abs(houses[i] - houses[j]), n - abs(houses[i] - houses[j]))
                    minDist = min(minDist, dist)
            
            if minDist >= threshold:
                count += 1
        
        return count
