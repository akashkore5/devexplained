### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that binds a given function to a specific context. This means that when the bound function is called, it will be executed in the context of the provided object.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. We can achieve this by creating a new function that, when called, will execute the original function with the desired context.
2. This can be done by using a closure in which we capture both the function to be bound and the context object.
3. When the bound function is called, we invoke the original function with the provided context using the `apply` or `call` method.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(1) as the binding operation is done in constant time.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity for this solution is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.
```java
public class BindFunction {
    public static Runnable bindFunctionToContext(Runnable func, Object context) {
        return () -> func.run();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable originalFunction = () -> System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        Object context = new Object();

        Runnable boundFunction = bindFunctionToContext(originalFunction, context);
        boundFunction.run(); // This will print "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

auto bindFunctionToContext(auto func, auto context) {
    return [=]() { func(); };
}

int main() {
    auto originalFunction = []() { std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; };
    auto context = new int;

    auto boundFunction = bindFunctionToContext(originalFunction, context);
    boundFunction(); // This will print "Hello, World!"
    return 0;
}
```

```python
def bind_function_to_context(func, context):
    return lambda: func()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    original_function = lambda: print("Hello, World!")
    context = {}

    bound_function = bind_function_to_context(original_function, context)
    bound_function()  # This will print "Hello, World!"
```
