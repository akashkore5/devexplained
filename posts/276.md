## Explanation:

The problem asks us to paint a fence with `n` posts, and there are `k` colors to choose from. We need to find the total number of ways to paint the fence such that no more than two adjacent posts have the same color.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can maintain two variables, `same` and `different`, to represent the number of ways to paint the current post the same color as the previous post and a different color from the previous post, respectively. 

For each post, we can calculate the new values of `same` and `different` based on the previous states. The new value of `same` is equal to the previous value of `different` because we can only paint the current post the same color as the previous post if the previous post is a different color. The new value of `different` is the sum of the previous values of `same` and `different` multiplied by `k-1` because we can paint the current post a different color in `k-1` ways.

We iterate through all posts and update the values of `same` and `different` accordingly. Finally, the total number of ways to paint the fence is the sum of the final values of `same` and `different`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of posts.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) since we are using only two variables to store the values of `same` and `different`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return k;

        int same = 0, different = k;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int newSame = different;
            int newDifferent = (same + different) * (k - 1);
            same = newSame;
            different = newDifferent;
        }
        return same + different;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return k;

        int same = 0, different = k;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int newSame = different;
            int newDifferent = (same + different) * (k - 1);
            same = newSame;
            different = newDifferent;
        }
        return same + different;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return k
        
        same, different = 0, k
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            new_same = different
            new_different = (same + different) * (k - 1)
            same = new_same
            different = new_different
        
        return same + different
```
