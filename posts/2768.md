### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given coordinates and mark the black cells on the grid. Then, we can count the number of blocks that contain exactly i black cells by iterating through each 2x2 submatrix of the grid.

1. Initialize a 2D grid of size m x n, initially all cells are white.
2. Iterate through the given coordinates and mark the black cells on the grid.
3. Count the number of blocks that contain exactly i black cells by iterating through each 2x2 submatrix of the grid and counting the black cells in each block.
4. Return an array arr of size 5 where arr[i] represents the number of blocks that contain exactly i black cells.

Time Complexity: O(m * n + coordinates.length)  
Space Complexity: O(m * n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBlackBlocks(int m, int n, int[][] coordinates) {
        int[][] grid = new int[m][n];
        
        for (int[] coord : coordinates) {
            grid[coord[0]][coord[1]] = 1;
        }
        
        int[] arr = new int[5];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                int blackCount = grid[i][j] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i+1][j+1];
                arr[blackCount]++;
            }
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBlackBlocks(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& coordinates) {
        vector<vector<int>> grid(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (auto coord : coordinates) {
            grid[coord[0]][coord[1]] = 1;
        }
        
        vector<int> arr(5, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                int blackCount = grid[i][j] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i+1][j+1];
                arr[blackCount]++;
            }
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countBlackBlocks(self, m: int, n: int, coordinates: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        for coord in coordinates:
            grid[coord[0]][coord[1]] = 1
        
        arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        
        for i in range(m - 1):
            for j in range(n - 1):
                black_count = grid[i][j] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i+1][j+1]
                arr[black_count] += 1
        
        return arr
