### Explanation:
To find the maximum achievable number, we need to understand that we can increase or decrease a number by 1 while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the target number by 1. The maximum achievable number will be the sum of the original number and the number of operations performed.

### Algorithm:
1. Calculate the difference between the target number `num` and the original number `x`.
2. If the difference is positive, we can perform `t` operations to increase `x` and decrease `num`.
3. If the difference is negative, we can perform `t` operations to decrease `x` and increase `num`.
4. The maximum achievable number will be `x + t` or `x - t` depending on the sign of the difference.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as it involves simple arithmetic operations.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximumAchievableNumber(int num, int t) {
        int diff = num - 1;
        int x = (diff >= 0) ? num + t : num - t;
        return x;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximumAchievableNumber(int num, int t) {
        int diff = num - 1;
        int x = (diff >= 0) ? num + t : num - t;
        return x;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaximumAchievableNumber(self, num: int, t: int) -> int:
        diff = num - 1
        x = num + t if diff >= 0 else num - t
        return x
```
