### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make all array elements equal to zero using the provided operation. One key observation is that the specific order in which the operations are applied does not matter. The goal is to transform the array such that all elements become zero.

1. We can calculate the remainder when each element in the array is divided by k. This remainder will help us determine how many operations are needed to make that element zero.
2. If the sum of all remainders is a multiple of k, then it is possible to make all array elements zero. This is because the sum of remainders represents the total "shift" required to make all elements zero.
3. If the sum of remainders is not a multiple of k, then it is not possible to make all array elements zero.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canBeMadeZero(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num % k;
        }
        return sum % k == 0;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeMadeZero(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num % k;
        }
        return sum % k == 0;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeMadeZero(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        total = sum(num % k for num in nums)
        return total % k == 0
```
