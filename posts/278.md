## Explanation

To find the first bad version, we can use binary search as it allows us to minimize the number of calls to the API. We start by setting two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last versions respectively. Then, we continuously check the middle version using the `isBadVersion` API and adjust the pointers accordingly based on whether the middle version is bad or not. We keep dividing the search space in half until we find the first bad version.

- Initialize `left = 1` and `right = n`
- While `left < right`:
  - Calculate the middle version as `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`
  - If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns true:
    - Update `right = mid`
  - Else:
    - Update `left = mid + 1`
- Return `left` as the first bad version

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(log n) as we are reducing the search space by half in each iteration of the binary search.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```

```cpp
// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

```python
def firstBadVersion(n):
    left = 1
    right = n
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if isBadVersion(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```
