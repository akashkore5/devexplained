## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of assigning seats to passengers based on their preferences. We need to consider both the waitlist of passengers and the current occupancy status of the flight. The key idea is to iterate through the waitlist and assign seats to passengers based on their seating preferences and the availability of seats. We can use a data structure like a priority queue to efficiently handle the assignment process.

1. Initialize a priority queue to store passengers from the waitlist based on their priority (e.g., first-class, business class, economy class).
2. Iterate through the waitlist and assign seats to passengers based on their preferences and seat availability.
3. Update the occupancy status of the flight based on the assigned seats.
4. Return the final occupancy status of the flight.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of passengers in the waitlist.
Space complexity: O(n) for the priority queue.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] flightOccupancy(int totalSeats, int[] waitlist) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> firstClass = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> businessClass = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> economyClass = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for (int passenger : waitlist) {
            if (passenger == 1) {
                firstClass.offer(passenger);
            } else if (passenger == 2) {
                businessClass.offer(passenger);
            } else {
                economyClass.offer(passenger);
            }
        }

        int[] occupancy = new int[totalSeats];
        Arrays.fill(occupancy, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < totalSeats; i++) {
            if (!firstClass.isEmpty()) {
                occupancy[i] = firstClass.poll();
            } else if (!businessClass.isEmpty()) {
                occupancy[i] = businessClass.poll();
            } else if (!economyClass.isEmpty()) {
                occupancy[i] = economyClass.poll();
            }
        }

        return occupancy;
    }
}
