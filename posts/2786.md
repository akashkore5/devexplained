### Explanation:
- **Algorithmic Idea:** We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will iterate through the array and maintain two states for each position: the maximum score if we include the current position and the maximum score if we exclude the current position. We will update these states based on the rules mentioned in the problem description.
- **Step-by-Step Iterations:**
  1. Initialize two arrays `include` and `exclude` to keep track of the maximum scores at each position.
  2. Iterate through the array and update `include` and `exclude` based on the rules.
  3. At each position, we can either include the current element (if allowed) by adding the current score to the maximum score excluding the previous element or exclude the current element by taking the maximum of the previous maximum scores.
  4. Return the maximum score at the last position.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the `include` and `exclude` arrays.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int visitArrayPositions(int[] nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] include = new int[n];
        int[] exclude = new int[n];
        include[0] = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            include[i] = Math.max(include[i - 1] + nums[i], exclude[i - 1] + nums[i]);
            exclude[i] = Math.max(include[i - 1], exclude[i - 1] - x);
        }

        return Math.max(include[n - 1], exclude[n - 1]);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int visitArrayPositions(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> include(n);
        vector<int> exclude(n);
        include[0] = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            include[i] = max(include[i - 1] + nums[i], exclude[i - 1] + nums[i]);
            exclude[i] = max(include[i - 1], exclude[i - 1] - x);
        }

        return max(include[n - 1], exclude[n - 1]);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def visitArrayPositions(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        include = [0] * n
        exclude = [0] * n
        include[0] = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            include[i] = max(include[i - 1] + nums[i], exclude[i - 1] + nums[i])
            exclude[i] = max(include[i - 1], exclude[i - 1] - x)

        return max(include[n - 1], exclude[n - 1])
