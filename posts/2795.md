## Explanation

To solve this problem, we will use the concept of parallel execution of promises. We will create multiple promises that represent individual tasks that need to be executed concurrently. Each promise will retrieve its result independently, and we will wait for all promises to complete before returning the final results.

Here is the algorithm:
1. Create a list of promises, each representing an individual task that needs to be executed.
2. Execute all promises concurrently to retrieve their results.
3. Wait for all promises to complete.
4. Return the results of all promises.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of promises/tasks
Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the promises
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> executePromises(List<CompletableFuture<Integer>> promises) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> allOf = CompletableFuture.allOf(promises.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]));
        return allOf.thenApply(v -> promises.stream()
                .map(CompletableFuture::join)
                .collect(Collectors.toList()))
                .join();
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <future>

std::vector<int> executePromises(std::vector<std::future<int>>& promises) {
    std::vector<std::future<void>> allFutures;
    for (auto& promise : promises) {
        allFutures.push_back(std::move(promise));
    }
    for (auto& future : allFutures) {
        future.wait();
    }
    std::vector<int> results;
    for (auto& promise : promises) {
        results.push_back(promise.get());
    }
    return results;
}
```

```python
from concurrent.futures import as_completed, ThreadPoolExecutor

def execute_promises(promises):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(lambda p: p.result(), promises))
    return results
```
