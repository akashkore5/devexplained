### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate through the `hours` array and count the number of employees who worked at least `target` hours. We can simply check if the current number of hours is greater than or equal to the target and increment a counter variable. At the end, we return the counter as the result.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of employees
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfEmployees(int[] hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < hours.length; i++) {
            if (hours[i] >= target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfEmployees(vector<int>& hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < hours.size(); i++) {
            if (hours[i] >= target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfEmployees(self, hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for hour in hours:
            if hour >= target:
                count += 1
        return count
```
