### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) to find the k-th lucky number. We start with the number 1 in the priority queue, then repeatedly extract the minimum number from the queue, and for each extracted number x, we insert both x*2 and x*3 into the queue. We continue this process until we have extracted k numbers from the queue, at which point we return the k-th number as the answer.

The idea behind this approach is that by generating new lucky numbers from the current lucky numbers (either by multiplying by 2 or 3), we ensure that the numbers in the priority queue are always in sorted order. This allows us to efficiently find the k-th lucky number by extracting k times from the priority queue.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(k*log(k)) where k is the input parameter denoting the k-th lucky number to find.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(k) to store the k lucky numbers in the priority queue.

:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int findKthLucky(int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Long> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        pq.offer(1L);

        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            long current = pq.poll();
            pq.offer(current * 2);
            pq.offer(current * 3);
        }

        return Math.toIntExact(pq.poll());
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLucky(int k) {
        priority_queue<long, vector<long>, greater<long>> pq;
        pq.push(1);

        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            long current = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(current * 2);
            pq.push(current * 3);
        }

        return pq.top();
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findKthLucky(self, k: int) -> int:
        pq = [1]
        
        for i in range(k - 1):
            current = heapq.heappop(pq)
            heapq.heappush(pq, current * 2)
            heapq.heappush(pq, current * 3)
        
        return pq[0]
```
