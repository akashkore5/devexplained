### Explanation:
To generate the factorial of a given number, we can use a simple iterative approach where we start from 1 and multiply it with all integers up to the given number. This way, we calculate the factorial result.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `factorial` to 1.
2. Iterate from 1 to the given number.
3. Multiply the current number with the `factorial` variable.
4. Update the `factorial` variable with the result of multiplication.
5. Return the `factorial` variable as the final result.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the given number for which we need to calculate the factorial.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int generateFactorial(int n) {
        int factorial = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }
        return factorial;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int generateFactorial(int n) {
    int factorial = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        factorial *= i;
    }
    return factorial;
}
```

```python
def generate_factorial(n):
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial
```
