### Explanation

In this problem, we are tasked with implementing a function similar to the `forEach` method available for arrays in JavaScript. The function will iterate over each element of the given array and apply a provided callback function to each element.

### Algorithmic Idea

1. Iterate over each element in the array.
2. Apply the provided callback function to each element.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

```java
public class ArrayPrototypeForEach {
    public static void forEach(int[] arr, IntConsumer action) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            action.accept(num);
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void forEach(vector<int>& arr, function<void(int)> action) {
    for (int num : arr) {
        action(num);
    }
}
```

```python
def forEach(arr, action):
    for num in arr:
        action(num)
```
