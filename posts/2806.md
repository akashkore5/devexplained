### Explanation:
- We need to round the `purchaseAmount` to the nearest multiple of 10 and then subtract this rounded amount from the initial bank account balance of 100 dollars to get the final balance.
- We can round the `purchaseAmount` using the formula `(purchaseAmount + 5) / 10 * 10`.
- The final balance will be calculated as `100 - roundedAmount`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int balanceAfterPurchase(int purchaseAmount) {
        int roundedAmount = (purchaseAmount + 5) / 10 * 10;
        return 100 - roundedAmount;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int balanceAfterPurchase(int purchaseAmount) {
        int roundedAmount = (purchaseAmount + 5) / 10 * 10;
        return 100 - roundedAmount;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def balanceAfterPurchase(self, purchaseAmount: int) -> int:
        roundedAmount = (purchaseAmount + 5) // 10 * 10
        return 100 - roundedAmount
```
