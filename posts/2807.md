### Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate over the linked list and insert a new node between each pair of adjacent nodes. The value of the new node is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of the two adjacent nodes.

We can find the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and updates the numbers until the smaller number becomes zero. The last non-zero number is the GCD.

### Algorithm
1. Iterate over the linked list starting from the head.
2. For each pair of adjacent nodes, calculate the GCD of their values.
3. Insert a new node with the GCD value between the two adjacent nodes.
4. Move to the next pair of nodes and repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the list.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * log(maxVal)), where n is the number of nodes in the list and maxVal is the maximum value in the list. Calculating the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm has a time complexity of log(maxVal).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode insertGCD(ListNode head) {
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            int gcd = calculateGCD(current.val, current.next.val);
            ListNode newNode = new ListNode(gcd);
            newNode.next = current.next;
            current.next = newNode;
            current = newNode.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
    
    private int calculateGCD(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : calculateGCD(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* insertGCD(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* current = head;
        while (current && current->next) {
            int gcd = calculateGCD(current->val, current->next->val);
            ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(gcd);
            newNode->next = current->next;
            current->next = newNode;
            current = newNode->next;
        }
        return head;
    }
    
private:
    int calculateGCD(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : calculateGCD(b, a % b);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def insertGCD(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        current = head
        while current and current.next:
            gcd_val = self.calculateGCD(current.val, current.next.val)
            new_node = ListNode(gcd_val)
            new_node.next = current.next
            current.next = new_node
            current = new_node.next
        return head
    
    def calculateGCD(self, a, b):
        return a if b == 0 else self.calculateGCD(b, a % b)
```
