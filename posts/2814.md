## Explanation:

This problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm with a slight modification to handle the constraints given. The idea is to maintain a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is based on the arrival time at that node. We initialize the priority queue with the starting node and its arrival time as 0. At each step, we pop the node with the minimum arrival time from the priority queue and update the arrival time of its neighbors based on the constraints provided in the problem. We continue this process until we reach the destination node or exhaust all reachable nodes.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a priority queue (min heap) to store nodes based on their arrival time.
2. Initialize the priority queue with the starting node and arrival time as 0.
3. While the priority queue is not empty:
    - Pop the node with the minimum arrival time from the priority queue.
    - If the popped node is the destination, return its arrival time.
    - Update the arrival time of its neighbors based on the constraints:
        - If the water level at the neighbor's arrival time is less than or equal to the current water level and the neighbor's arrival time is greater than the current arrival time plus the time taken to travel to that neighbor, update the neighbor's arrival time and push it back to the priority queue.
4. If the destination node is not reachable, return -1.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V) to store the nodes in the priority queue.
