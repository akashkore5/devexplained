## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array `nums` and keep track of the minimum absolute difference between elements that are at least `x` indices apart. We can achieve this by maintaining a sliding window of size `x` and updating the minimum absolute difference as we move along the array.

1. Initialize `minDiff` to a large value.
2. Iterate through the array from index `0` to `n-x-1`, where `n` is the length of the array.
3. For each index `i`, calculate the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i+x]`.
4. Update `minDiff` if the calculated absolute difference is smaller than the current `minDiff`.
5. Return the final `minDiff`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums, int x) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - x; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[i + x] - nums[i]);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - x; i++) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[i + x] - nums[i]);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        minDiff = float('inf')

        for i in range(n - x):
            minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[i + x] - nums[i])

        return minDiff
```
