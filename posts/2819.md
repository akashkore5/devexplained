## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the potential minimum relative loss for each chocolate. We start by iterating over the prices array and adding each pair of prices with their corresponding indices to the priority queue. As we iterate, we check if the current price is less than the top price in the priority queue. If it is, we calculate the relative loss and update the minimum relative loss if necessary.

After processing all prices, we return the minimum relative loss.

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Initialize a priority queue (min heap) to store prices with their indices.
2. Iterate over the prices array and add each pair of price and index to the priority queue.
3. For each price, check if it is less than the top price in the priority queue.
4. If it is, calculate the relative loss and update the minimum relative loss if necessary.
5. Return the minimum relative loss after processing all prices.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the number of prices in the input array. This is due to the insertion and extraction operations on the priority queue.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) to store the priority queue and the input prices array.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minimumLoss(long[] prices) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Long.compare(b[0], a[0]));
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            pq.offer(new int[]{prices[i], i});
        }
        
        int minLoss = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int[] next = pq.peek();
            if (curr[1] < next[1]) {
                minLoss = Math.min(minLoss, (int) (curr[0] - next[0]));
            }
        }
        
        return minLoss;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLoss(vector<long>& prices) {
        priority_queue<pair<long, int>> pq;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            pq.push({prices[i], i});
        }

        int minLoss = INT_MAX;
        while (pq.size() > 1) {
            auto curr = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            auto next = pq.top();
            if (curr.second < next.second) {
                minLoss = min(minLoss, (int) (curr.first - next.first));
            }
        }

        return minLoss;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minimumLoss(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        pq = [(-price, idx) for idx, price in enumerate(prices)]
        heapq.heapify(pq)

        min_loss = float('inf')
        while len(pq) > 1:
            curr = heapq.heappop(pq)
            next_price = pq[0]
            if curr[1] < next_price[1]:
                min_loss = min(min_loss, curr[0] - next_price[0])

        return -min_loss
```
