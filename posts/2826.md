## Explanation:
To solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time complexity, we can iterate through the array once and count the number of occurrences of each value (1, 2, 3). Then, we can calculate the minimum number of removals needed by considering the possible scenarios for each group of numbers.

Here is the step-by-step approach:
1. Count the occurrences of each value in the array.
2. Calculate the total number of elements that need to be removed to make each group non-decreasing.
3. Return the minimum number of removals needed.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

:

```java
public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) count1++;
        else if (num == 2) count2++;
        else count3++;
    }
    
    int operations1 = nums.length - count1 - count2;
    int operations2 = count1 + count3;
    int operations3 = Math.max(count1, count3);
    
    return Math.min(operations1, Math.min(operations2, operations3));
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 1) count1++;
        else if (num == 2) count2++;
        else count3++;
    }
    
    int operations1 = nums.size() - count1 - count2;
    int operations2 = count1 + count3;
    int operations3 = max(count1, count3);
    
    return min(operations1, min(operations2, operations3));
}
```

### Python
```python
def minOperations(nums):
    count1 = count2 = count3 = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num == 1:
            count1 += 1
        elif num == 2:
            count2 += 1
        else:
            count3 += 1
    
    operations1 = len(nums) - count1 - count2
    operations2 = count1 + count3
    operations3 = max(count1, count3)
    
    return min(operations1, operations2, operations3)
```
