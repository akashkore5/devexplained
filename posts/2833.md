## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the `moves` string and keep track of the current position based on the movement directions. We can initialize the position as 0, then update it by moving left or right based on the characters in the `moves` string. Finally, we return the absolute value of the furthest position reached.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize `position` as 0.
2. Iterate through the characters in `moves`.
3. If the character is 'L', decrement `position` by 1.
4. If the character is 'R', increment `position` by 1.
5. If the character is '_', maintain the current position (no change).
6. Calculate the absolute value of `position` after all moves.
7. Return the absolute value as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `moves` string.
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int furthestPoint(String moves) {
        int position = 0;
        for (char move : moves.toCharArray()) {
            if (move == 'L') {
                position--;
            } else if (move == 'R') {
                position++;
            }
        }
        return Math.abs(position);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int furthestPoint(std::string moves) {
        int position = 0;
        for (char move : moves) {
            if (move == 'L') {
                position--;
            } else if (move == 'R') {
                position++;
            }
        }
        return std::abs(position);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def furthestPoint(self, moves: str) -> int:
        position = 0
        for move in moves:
            if move == 'L':
                position -= 1
            elif move == 'R':
                position += 1
        return abs(position)
```
