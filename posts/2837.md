## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by a car given its speed and a series of timestamps. We can calculate the distance traveled at each time interval and sum them up to get the total traveled distance.

1. Initialize variables `totalDistance` and `prevTime` to 0 and null respectively.
2. Iterate through the timestamps and for each timestamp:
   - If `prevTime` is not null, calculate the time interval `timeInterval` as the difference between the current timestamp and `prevTime`.
   - Calculate the distance traveled in this time interval by multiplying the speed and time interval.
   - Update `totalDistance` by adding the distance traveled in the current time interval.
   - Update `prevTime` to the current timestamp.
3. Return the `totalDistance` as the final result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of timestamps.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public double totalTraveledDistance(int[] timestamps, int[] speed) {
        double totalDistance = 0;
        Integer prevTime = null;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < timestamps.length; i++) {
            if (prevTime != null) {
                int timeInterval = timestamps[i] - prevTime;
                double distance = speed[i] * timeInterval;
                totalDistance += distance;
            }
            prevTime = timestamps[i];
        }
        
        return totalDistance;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double totalTraveledDistance(vector<int>& timestamps, vector<int>& speed) {
        double totalDistance = 0;
        int prevTime = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < timestamps.size(); i++) {
            if (prevTime != 0) {
                int timeInterval = timestamps[i] - prevTime;
                double distance = speed[i] * timeInterval;
                totalDistance += distance;
            }
            prevTime = timestamps[i];
        }
        
        return totalDistance;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def totalTraveledDistance(self, timestamps: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> float:
        totalDistance = 0
        prevTime = None
        
        for i in range(len(timestamps)):
            if prevTime is not None:
                timeInterval = timestamps[i] - prevTime
                distance = speed[i] * timeInterval
                totalDistance += distance
            prevTime = timestamps[i]
        
        return totalDistance
```
