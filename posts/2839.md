### Explanation:
To check if two strings `s1` and `s2` can be made equal with the given operation, we can use a simple approach.
1. We need to check if the characters in `s1` and `s2` are the same, regardless of their order. If the frequency of each character in both strings is the same, then the two strings can be made equal using the given operation.
2. We can iterate through both strings and count the frequency of each character. If the frequency counts match, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the strings `s1` and `s2`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array to store the character frequencies.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canBeMadeEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        int[] count1 = new int[26];
        int[] count2 = new int[26];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            count1[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            count2[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count1[i] != count2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeMadeEqual(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
        std::vector<int> count1(26, 0);
        std::vector<int> count2(26, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            count1[s1[i] - 'a']++;
            count2[s2[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count1[i] != count2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeMadeEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        count1 = [0] * 26
        count2 = [0] * 26
        
        for i in range(4):
            count1[ord(s1[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
            count2[ord(s2[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        for i in range(26):
            if count1[i] != count2[i]:
                return False
        
        return True
```
