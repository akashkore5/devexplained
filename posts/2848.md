### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each car's range and mark the points on the number line that are covered by any car. We can do this by maintaining an array of size 101 (as the constraints state that the range of points can be from 1 to 100). For each car's range [starti, endi], we mark all the points from starti to endi (inclusive) in the array. Finally, we count the number of marked points in the array.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of cars.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the array size is constant.```java
class Solution {
    public int intersectingPoints(int[][] nums) {
        int[] points = new int[101];
        for (int[] car : nums) {
            for (int i = car[0]; i <= car[1]; i++) {
                points[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int point : points) {
            if (point == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int intersectingPoints(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        vector<int> points(101, 0);
        for (auto car : nums) {
            for (int i = car[0]; i <= car[1]; i++) {
                points[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int point : points) {
            if (point == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python

```python
class Solution:
    def intersectingPoints(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points = [0] * 101
        for car in nums:
            for i in range(car[0], car[1] + 1):
                points[i] = 1
                
        count = 0
        for point in points:
            if point == 1:
                count += 1
        
        return count
```
