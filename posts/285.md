### Explanation
To find the inorder successor in a BST, we can follow these steps:
1. If the right child of the current node is not null, then the successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree.
2. If the right child of the current node is null, then we need to backtrack to find the successor. We keep track of the potential successor as we traverse the tree.
3. When we find the target node, if its right child is not null, then the successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree of the target node. Otherwise, the potential successor stored while traversing is the actual successor.

Time complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
Space complexity: O(1) if not considering the recursion stack.

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode successor = null;
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val > p.val) {
                successor = root;
                root = root.left;
            } else {
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        return successor;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        TreeNode* successor = nullptr;
        while (root) {
            if (root->val > p->val) {
                successor = root;
                root = root->left;
            } else {
                root = root->right;
            }
        }
        return successor;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def inorderSuccessor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        successor = None
        while root:
            if root.val > p.val:
                successor = root
                root = root.left
            else:
                root = root.right
        return successor
```
