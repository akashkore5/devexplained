### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to spread the stones over the grid such that each cell has exactly one stone. We can approach this problem by observing the initial positions of the stones and determining the minimum moves needed to redistribute them.

1. Calculate the total number of stones in the grid.
2. Determine the number of stones already in their correct position (cells with 1 stone).
3. If there are stones not in their correct position, distribute them in a way that minimizes the number of moves required.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(int[][] grid) {
        int totalStones = 0;
        int correctPositionStones = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                totalStones += grid[i][j];
                if ((i == 0 && j == 0) || (i == 2 && j == 2)) {
                    correctPositionStones += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int moves = 0;
        int neededMoves = 2;
        
        if (totalStones == 9) {
            moves = Math.max(0, totalStones - correctPositionStones - neededMoves);
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int totalStones = 0;
        int correctPositionStones = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                totalStones += grid[i][j];
                if ((i == 0 && j == 0) || (i == 2 && j == 2)) {
                    correctPositionStones += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int moves = 0;
        int neededMoves = 2;
        
        if (totalStones == 9) {
            moves = max(0, totalStones - correctPositionStones - neededMoves);
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumMoves(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total_stones = 0
        correct_position_stones = 0
        
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                total_stones += grid[i][j]
                if (i == 0 and j == 0) or (i == 2 and j == 2):
                    correct_position_stones += grid[i][j]
        
        moves = 0
        needed_moves = 2
        
        if total_stones == 9:
            moves = max(0, total_stones - correct_position_stones - needed_moves)
        
        return moves
```
