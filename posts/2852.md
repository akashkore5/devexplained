## Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the sum of remoteness of all cells in a grid. The remoteness of a cell is defined as the sum of the Manhattan distances between that cell and all other cells in the grid. We need to calculate the remoteness for each cell and return the sum of all remoteness values.

To solve this problem, we can iterate over each cell in the grid and calculate the distance between that cell and every other cell in the grid. We can use the Manhattan distance formula, which is the sum of the absolute differences between the x and y coordinates of two points.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `totalRemoteness` to store the sum of remoteness for all cells.
2. Iterate over each cell `(i, j)` in the grid.
3. For each cell, iterate over all other cells in the grid and calculate the Manhattan distance between the current cell and the other cell.
4. Add the calculated distance to the `totalRemoteness`.
5. Return `totalRemoteness` as the final result.

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of cells in the grid.
Space Complexity: O(1).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfRemoteness(int[][] grid) {
        int totalRemoteness = 0;
        int n = grid.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
                        totalRemoteness += Math.abs(i - k) + Math.abs(j - l);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return totalRemoteness;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfRemoteness(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int totalRemoteness = 0;
        int n = grid.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {
                        totalRemoteness += abs(i - k) + abs(j - l);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return totalRemoteness;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfRemoteness(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        totalRemoteness = 0
        n = len(grid)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                for k in range(n):
                    for l in range(n):
                        totalRemoteness += abs(i - k) + abs(j - l)
        
        return totalRemoteness
```
