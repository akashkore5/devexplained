## Explanation:
To find the highest difference between two salaries in an array, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the minimum and maximum salary encountered so far. At each step, we update the minimum and maximum values if we find a lower minimum or a higher maximum salary. Finally, we return the difference between the maximum and minimum salaries.

- Initialize `minSalary` and `maxSalary` to the first element in the array.
- Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
- Update `minSalary` and `maxSalary` if a lower minimum or a higher maximum salary is found.
- Calculate the difference between `maxSalary` and `minSalary` and return it.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSalaryDifference(int[] salaries) {
        int minSalary = salaries[0];
        int maxSalary = salaries[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < salaries.length; i++) {
            minSalary = Math.min(minSalary, salaries[i]);
            maxSalary = Math.max(maxSalary, salaries[i]);
        }
        
        return maxSalary - minSalary;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSalaryDifference(vector<int>& salaries) {
        int minSalary = salaries[0];
        int maxSalary = salaries[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < salaries.size(); i++) {
            minSalary = min(minSalary, salaries[i]);
            maxSalary = max(maxSalary, salaries[i]);
        }
        
        return maxSalary - minSalary;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSalaryDifference(self, salaries: List[int]) -> int:
        minSalary = salaries[0]
        maxSalary = salaries[0]
        
        for salary in salaries[1:]:
            minSalary = min(minSalary, salary)
            maxSalary = max(maxSalary, salary)
        
        return maxSalary - minSalary
```
