## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a queue to maintain the rolling average of the last `k` steps. We will keep track of the sum of the last `k` steps and update it as new steps are added and old steps are removed. This way, we can calculate the rolling average by dividing the sum by `k`.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a queue to store the last `k` steps and a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of the last `k` steps.
2. Iterate through each step in the input list:
   - If the size of the queue is less than `k`, add the step to the queue and update the sum.
   - If the size of the queue is equal to `k`, remove the oldest step from the queue, subtract it from the sum, add the new step to the queue, and update the sum.
   - Calculate the rolling average by dividing the sum by `k` and store it in the result list.
3. Return the list of rolling averages.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of steps in the input list.
Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the size of the rolling window.

:

```java
class RollingAverageSteps {
    public double[] rollingAverage(int[] steps, int k) {
        double[] result = new double[steps.length - k + 1];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int sum = 0;
        int index = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < steps.length; i++) {
            if (queue.size() < k) {
                queue.offer(steps[i]);
                sum += steps[i];
            } else {
                result[index] = (double) sum / k;
                sum -= queue.poll();
                queue.offer(steps[i]);
                sum += steps[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        
        result[index] = (double) sum / k;
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class RollingAverageSteps {
public:
    vector<double> rollingAverage(vector<int>& steps, int k) {
        vector<double> result(steps.size() - k + 1);
        queue<int> q;
        int sum = 0;
        int index = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < steps.size(); i++) {
            if (q.size() < k) {
                q.push(steps[i]);
                sum += steps[i];
            } else {
                result[index] = (double) sum / k;
                sum -= q.front();
                q.pop();
                q.push(steps[i]);
                sum += steps[i];
                index++;
            }
        }

        result[index] = (double) sum / k;

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
from collections import deque

class RollingAverageSteps:
    def rollingAverage(self, steps: List[int], k: int) -> List[float]:
        result = [0.0] * (len(steps) - k + 1)
        queue = deque()
        sum_val = 0
        index = 0

        for i in range(len(steps)):
            if len(queue) < k:
                queue.append(steps[i])
                sum_val += steps[i]
            else:
                result[index] = float(sum_val) / k
                sum_val -= queue.popleft()
                queue.append(steps[i])
                sum_val += steps[i]
                index += 1

        result[index] = float(sum_val) / k

        return result
```
