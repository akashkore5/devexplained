## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the elements in the array. We iterate through the array, and for each element, we compare it with the top element of the stack. If the current element is greater than the top element, we can remove both elements as a pair since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the current element is not greater than the top element, we push the current element onto the stack.

After processing all elements, the remaining elements in the stack represent the elements that cannot be removed in pairs. The size of the stack gives us the minimum length of the array after pair removals.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array nums.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array nums.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPairLength(int[] nums) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (!stack.isEmpty() && num > stack.peek()) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                stack.push(num);
            }
        }
        return stack.size();
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPairLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        stack<int> st;
        for (int num : nums) {
            while (!st.empty() && num > st.top()) {
                st.pop();
            }
            st.push(num);
        }
        return st.size();
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minPairLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for num in nums:
            while stack and num > stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(num)
        return len(stack)
```
