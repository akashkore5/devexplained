### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array of student numbers and count the number of students that must be selected or not selected to make all students happy. We can use a prefix sum array to simplify the calculation. For each student, we can calculate the minimum number of students that need to be selected to make that student happy and the maximum number of students that need to be selected to make the student happy. Then, we can count the number of ways to select students based on these minimum and maximum values.

- Initialize variables to keep track of the total number of students to be selected and not selected.
- Iterate through the array of student numbers and calculate the minimum and maximum number of students that need to be selected to make each student happy.
- Update the total number of students to be selected and not selected based on these minimum and maximum values.
- Finally, return the count of ways to select students that make all students happy.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int happyStudents(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int totalSelected = 0, totalNotSelected = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minSelected = Math.max(0, i - nums[i] + 1);
            int maxSelected = Math.min(i, nums[i]);
            totalSelected += maxSelected;
            totalNotSelected += n - 1 - minSelected;
        }
        
        return totalSelected < n ? 0 : Math.min(totalSelected - n + 1, totalNotSelected + 1);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int happyStudents(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int totalSelected = 0, totalNotSelected = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minSelected = max(0, i - nums[i] + 1);
            int maxSelected = min(i, nums[i]);
            totalSelected += maxSelected;
            totalNotSelected += n - 1 - minSelected;
        }
        
        return totalSelected < n ? 0 : min(totalSelected - n + 1, totalNotSelected + 1);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def happyStudents(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        totalSelected, totalNotSelected = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            minSelected = max(0, i - nums[i] + 1)
            maxSelected = min(i, nums[i])
            totalSelected += maxSelected
            totalNotSelected += n - 1 - minSelected
        
        return 0 if totalSelected < n else min(totalSelected - n + 1, totalNotSelected + 1)
```
