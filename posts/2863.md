## Explanation:

Given an array of integers, we need to find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that is semi-decreasing. A subarray is considered semi-decreasing if at most one element needs to be removed in order to make the entire subarray in non-increasing order.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will iterate over the array and keep track of the current subarray that is semi-decreasing. We will maintain a variable to store the length of the longest semi-decreasing subarray found so far.

Here is the algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `start` and `maxLength` to 0.
2. Iterate over the array using a sliding window:
   - If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, we can extend the current semi-decreasing subarray.
   - If the current element is less than the previous element, we need to consider removing the previous element to maintain semi-decreasing order. In this case, update `start` to the index of the previous element.
   - Update `maxLength` to be the maximum of `maxLength` and the length of the current subarray.
3. Return `maxLength`.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxLengthSemiDecreasing(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]) {
                continue;
            }
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - start);
            start = i;
        }
        
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, nums.length - start);
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLengthSemiDecreasing(vector<int>& nums) {
        int start = 0, maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]) {
                continue;
            }
            
            maxLength = max(maxLength, i - start);
            start = i;
        }
        
        maxLength = max(maxLength, (int)nums.size() - start);
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxLengthSemiDecreasing(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start = 0
        maxLength = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            
            maxLength = max(maxLength, i - start)
            start = i
        
        maxLength = max(maxLength, len(nums) - start)
        
        return maxLength
```
