## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find a beautiful configuration of towers that maximizes the sum of heights. A configuration is considered beautiful if it satisfies the conditions given in the problem description.

We can approach this problem by iterating through the array and finding the peak index where the mountain pattern changes. Then, we can assign heights to the towers in a way that the conditions are satisfied.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:
1. Iterate through the array to find the peak index where the mountain pattern changes. Let this index be `peakIndex`.
2. Assign heights for towers from index 0 to `peakIndex` in non-decreasing order (starting from 1).
3. Assign heights for towers from `peakIndex` to the end in non-increasing order (starting from the minimum of `maxHeights[peakIndex]` and `maxHeights[peakIndex+1]`).

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the heights of towers.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[] maxHeights) {
        int n = maxHeights.length;
        int peakIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (maxHeights[i] > maxHeights[i - 1]) {
                peakIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        int[] heights = new int[n];
        int minHeight = Math.min(maxHeights[peakIndex], peakIndex < n - 1 ? maxHeights[peakIndex + 1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= peakIndex; i++) {
            heights[i] = i + 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = peakIndex + 1; i < n; i++) {
            heights[i] = Math.max(minHeight, 1);
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int height : heights) {
            sum += height;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<int>& maxHeights) {
        int n = maxHeights.size();
        int peakIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (maxHeights[i] > maxHeights[i - 1]) {
                peakIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> heights(n);
        int minHeight = min(maxHeights[peakIndex], peakIndex < n - 1 ? maxHeights[peakIndex + 1] : INT_MAX);
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= peakIndex; i++) {
            heights[i] = i + 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = peakIndex + 1; i < n; i++) {
            heights[i] = max(minHeight, 1);
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int height : heights) {
            sum += height;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, maxHeights: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(maxHeights)
        peakIndex = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if maxHeights[i] > maxHeights[i - 1]:
                peakIndex = i
        
        heights = [0] * n
        minHeight = min(maxHeights[peakIndex], maxHeights[peakIndex + 1] if peakIndex < n - 1 else float('inf'))
        
        for i in range(peakIndex + 1):
            heights[i] = i + 1
        
        for i in range(peakIndex + 1, n):
            heights[i] = max(minHeight, 1)
        
        return sum(heights)
