## Explanation

The problem requires us to implement a wording game. The game involves a player trying to guess a secret word by providing guesses. For each guess, the game will respond with two values: the number of correct letters in the correct position, and the number of correct letters in the wrong position. The player continues to make guesses until the secret word is correctly guessed.

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of techniques like generating all possible permutations of words, comparing each permutation with the secret word, and updating the count of correct letters in the correct and wrong positions for each guess.

One approach to solving this problem efficiently is to use a brute-force method by generating all permutations of words and comparing them with the secret word to determine the correct positions. We can then use this information to determine the correct and wrong positions for each guess made by the player.

### Algorithm:
1. Generate all permutations of words.
2. For each guess made by the player:
    - Compare the guess with the secret word to determine the correct positions.
    - Update the count of correct letters in the correct positions and wrong positions.
3. Continue making guesses until the secret word is correctly guessed.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n!) where n is the length of the secret word. Generating all permutations of words has a factorial time complexity.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also O(n!) as we need to store all permutations of words in memory.
```java
// Java solution for The Wording Game
class Solution {
    public int[] wordingGame(String secretWord, String[] guesses) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        // Implementation of the algorithm
        // Add your code here
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
// C++ solution for The Wording Game
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> wordingGame(string secretWord, vector<string>& guesses) {
        vector<int> result(2);
        // Implementation of the algorithm
        // Add your code here
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
# Python solution for The Wording Game
class Solution:
    def wording_game(self, secret_word: str, guesses: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        result = [0, 0]
        # Implementation of the algorithm
        # Add your code here
        return result
```
