### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of collecting elements 1 to k in order. We iterate through the given array `nums` and maintain a set to keep track of the elements we have collected so far. For each element in `nums`, if it is one of the elements we need to collect, we remove it from the set. If the set becomes empty, it means we have collected all elements from 1 to k. We keep track of the number of operations needed to achieve this.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Initialize a set `collected` to keep track of the elements we have collected so far.
2. Initialize a variable `operations` to count the number of operations.
3. Iterate through the array `nums`:
    - If the current element is in the `collected` set, remove it.
    - If the set becomes empty, increment `operations` and clear the set.
4. Return the final count of `operations`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(k) where k is the maximum value of k.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Set<Integer> collected = new HashSet<>();
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (collected.contains(num)) {
                collected.remove(num);
                if (collected.isEmpty()) {
                    operations++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_set<int> collected;
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (collected.count(num)) {
                collected.erase(num);
                if (collected.empty()) {
                    operations++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        collected = set()
        operations = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num in collected:
                collected.remove(num)
                if not collected:
                    operations += 1
        
        return operations
```
