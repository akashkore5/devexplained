## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given array `nums` and keep track of the prefix AND of elements seen so far. At each index `i`, we calculate the prefix AND up to that index. If the prefix AND changes at index `i`, it indicates that we need to split the array at index `i` to minimize the sum of scores.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize a variable `prev` to store the prefix AND of elements seen so far, and a variable `count` to store the number of subarrays.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
   - Calculate the prefix AND up to the current index.
   - If the prefix AND changes compared to the previous element, increment the `count`.
3. Return the final `count`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int splitArray(int[] nums) {
        int prev = -1;
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int curr = prev & nums[i];
            if (curr != prev) {
                count++;
            }
            prev = curr;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int splitArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int prev = -1;
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int curr = prev & nums[i];
            if (curr != prev) {
                count++;
            }
            prev = curr;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def splitArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        prev = -1
        count = 1

        for num in nums:
            curr = prev & num
            if curr != prev:
                count += 1
            prev = curr

        return count
```
