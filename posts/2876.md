## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of visiting nodes starting from each node. We can use a visited array to keep track of which nodes have been visited. For each node, we follow the directed edges until we reach a node that has been visited before. We count the number of different nodes visited during this process and store it in the answer array.

- We initialize an answer array of size n to store the results.
- For each node i from 0 to n-1:
  - Initialize a visited array of size n to keep track of visited nodes.
  - Initialize a count variable to store the number of different nodes visited.
  - Start from node i and keep following the directed edges until we reach a visited node.
  - Increment the count for each different node visited.
  - Store the count in the answer array for node i.
- Return the answer array.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes  
Space Complexity: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countVisitedNodes(int[] edges) {
        int n = edges.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
            int count = 0;
            int curr = i;
            while (!visited[curr]) {
                visited[curr] = true;
                count++;
                curr = edges[curr];
            }
            answer[i] = count;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countVisitedNodes(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> answer(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            vector<bool> visited(n, false);
            int count = 0;
            int curr = i;
            while (!visited[curr]) {
                visited[curr] = true;
                count++;
                curr = edges[curr];
            }
            answer[i] = count;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countVisitedNodes(self, edges: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(edges)
        answer = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            visited = [False] * n
            count = 0
            curr = i
            while not visited[curr]:
                visited[curr] = True
                count += 1
                curr = edges[curr]
            answer[i] = count
        
        return answer
```
