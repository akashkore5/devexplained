## Explanation:
To correct the errors in the DataFrame by converting the grade column from floats to integers, we can iterate through each row and convert the grade value to an integer. This can be done by casting the float value to an integer. The algorithm is straightforward and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of rows in the DataFrame. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

:

```java
public void changeDataType(DataFrame students) {
    for (int i = 0; i < students.size(); i++) {
        int grade = (int) students.get(i).get("grade");
        students.get(i).put("grade", grade);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
void changeDataType(DataFrame &students) {
    for (int i = 0; i < students.size(); i++) {
        int grade = static_cast<int>(students[i]["grade"]);
        students[i]["grade"] = grade;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def change_data_type(students):
    for row in students:
        row["grade"] = int(row["grade"])
```
