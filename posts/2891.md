### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use method chaining in Python Pandas to filter the DataFrame based on the weight condition and then sort the resulting DataFrame by weight in descending order. Method chaining allows us to perform multiple operations on a DataFrame in a single line of code without creating temporary variables or breaking up the operations.

- Filter the DataFrame to include only animals with weight strictly more than 100 kilograms.
- Sort the filtered DataFrame by weight in descending order.
- Extract the names of the animals from the sorted DataFrame.

Time complexity: O(n log n) - sorting the DataFrame based on weight  
Space complexity: O(n) - space used for the resulting sorted DataFrame  

:

```java
// Java solution
// Not applicable as the problem can't be directly solved using method chaining in Java without a library like Pandas in Python
```

```cpp
// C++ solution
// Not applicable as the problem can't be directly solved using method chaining in C++
```

```python
# Python solution
result = df[df['weight'] > 100].sort_values(by='weight', ascending=False)['name']
```
