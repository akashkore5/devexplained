### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate two sums: the sum of numbers in the range [1, n] that are not divisible by m (`num1`) and the sum of numbers in the same range that are divisible by m (`num2`). The required answer is `num1 - num2`.

1. Calculate `num1`:
   - For each number `i` in the range [1, n], if `i` is not divisible by `m`, add `i` to `num1`.

2. Calculate `num2`:
   - Calculate the count of numbers in the range [1, n] that are divisible by `m` using the formula `count = n / m`.
   - The sum of all numbers divisible by `m` in the range [1, n] is `m * count`, where `count` is the number of multiples of `m` in the range [1, n].

3. Return the difference `num1 - num2`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are performing a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int subtractNonDivisible(int n, int m) {
        int num1 = 0;
        
        // Calculate num1
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % m != 0) {
                num1 += i;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate num2
        int count = n / m;
        int num2 = m * count;
        
        return num1 - num2;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subtractNonDivisible(int n, int m) {
        int num1 = 0;
        
        // Calculate num1
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % m != 0) {
                num1 += i;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate num2
        int count = n / m;
        int num2 = m * count;
        
        return num1 - num2;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def subtractNonDivisible(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        num1 = 0
        
        # Calculate num1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % m != 0:
                num1 += i
        
        # Calculate num2
        count = n // m
        num2 = m * count
        
        return num1 - num2
```
