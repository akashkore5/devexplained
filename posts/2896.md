## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost needed to make two binary strings `s1` and `s2` equal by applying specific operations. We can achieve this by iterating over both strings and comparing character by character. We consider two scenarios for each mismatch:

1. If `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`:
   - If we can flip adjacent characters in `s1`, we choose the operation with the minimum cost.
   - If we can flip characters at arbitrary indices in `s1`, we choose the operation with the minimum cost.
   - If neither operation is possible, we return -1.

2. If `s1[i]` is the same as `s2[i]`, we move to the next character.

Finally, we return the total cost required to make the strings equal or -1 if it is impossible.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the strings `s1` and `s2`.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMinCost(String s1, String s2, int x) {
        int cost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) {
                if (i + 1 < s1.length() && s1.charAt(i + 1) == s2.charAt(i + 1)) {
                    cost += Math.min(x, 2);
                    i++;
                } else if (x < 2) {
                    cost += x;
                } else {
                    return -1;
                }
            }
        }
        return cost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int getMinCost(std::string s1, std::string s2, int x) {
        int cost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); i++) {
            if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
                if (i + 1 < s1.size() && s1[i + 1] == s2[i + 1]) {
                    cost += std::min(x, 2);
                    i++;
                } else if (x < 2) {
                    cost += x;
                } else {
                    return -1;
                }
            }
        }
        return cost;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getMinCost(self, s1: str, s2: str, x: int) -> int:
        cost = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(s1):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                if i+1 < len(s1) and s1[i+1] == s2[i+1]:
                    cost += min(x, 2)
                    i += 1
                elif x < 2:
                    cost += x
                else:
                    return -1
            i += 1
        return cost
