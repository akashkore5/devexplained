## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the words and groups simultaneously, keeping track of the current longest alternating subsequence. We maintain two variables: `maxLen` to store the length of the longest alternating subsequence found so far, and `result` to store the actual subsequence.

We iterate through the words and groups, checking if the current word and the next word have different group values. If they do, we increment the current length and update the result accordingly. If they have the same group value, we reset the current length to 1.

Finally, we return the resulting subsequence.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of words/groups.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are only storing a constant number of variables.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> longestSubsequence(String[] words, int[] groups) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int maxLen = 0;
        int currLen = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
            if (groups[i] != groups[i + 1]) {
                currLen++;
                if (currLen > maxLen) {
                    maxLen = currLen;
                    result.clear();
                    result.add(words[i]);
                    result.add(words[i + 1]);
                }
            } else {
                currLen = 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> longestSubsequence(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& groups) {
        vector<string> result;
        int maxLen = 0;
        int currLen = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (groups[i] != groups[i + 1]) {
                currLen++;
                if (currLen > maxLen) {
                    maxLen = currLen;
                    result.clear();
                    result.push_back(words[i]);
                    result.push_back(words[i + 1]);
                }
            } else {
                currLen = 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, words: List[str], groups: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        max_len = 0
        curr_len = 1

        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            if groups[i] != groups[i + 1]:
                curr_len += 1
                if curr_len > max_len:
                    max_len = curr_len
                    result = [words[i], words[i + 1]]
            else:
                curr_len = 1

        return result
