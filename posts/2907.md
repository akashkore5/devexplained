### Explanation:

This problem asks us to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by selecting three numbers (a, b, c) from an array, where a < b < c. The profit is calculated as c - a. We need to return the maximum profit, or 0 if it is not possible to find three numbers satisfying the condition.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the minimum value for the first element (a), the maximum profit so far, and the potential third element (c). We update these values as we iterate through the array. If at any point we find a number greater than the potential third element (c), we update the potential third element and recalculate the profit.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        if (n < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int minFirst = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int potentialThird = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > potentialThird) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minFirst);
                potentialThird = prices[i];
            } else {
                minFirst = Math.min(minFirst, prices[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n < 3) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int minFirst = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int potentialThird = INT_MIN;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > potentialThird) {
                maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minFirst);
                potentialThird = prices[i];
            } else {
                minFirst = min(minFirst, prices[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if n < 3:
            return 0
        
        minFirst = prices[0]
        maxProfit = 0
        potentialThird = float('-inf')
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if prices[i] > potentialThird:
                maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minFirst)
                potentialThird = prices[i]
            else:
                minFirst = min(minFirst, prices[i])
        
        return maxProfit
```
