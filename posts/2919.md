### Explanation
To make the array beautiful, we need to ensure that for any subarray of size 3 or more, the maximum element is greater than or equal to `k`. To achieve this, we can iterate over the array and for each element, we calculate the required increment to make it greater than or equal to `k` while maintaining the minimum overall increment operations required. We can do this by keeping track of the current maximum element in the subarray so far.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize `ops` to 0 to keep track of the total increment operations needed.
2. Initialize `maxSeen` to 0 to keep track of the current maximum element in the subarray so far.
3. Iterate over the array:
   - If the current element is less than `k`, calculate the increment required to make it greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If the current element is greater than or equal to `k`, update `maxSeen`.
   - Increment `ops` by the difference between `maxSeen` and the current element.
4. Return `ops`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int ops = 0;
        int maxSeen = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < k) {
                ops += k - num;
            } else {
                maxSeen = Math.max(maxSeen, num);
            }
            ops += Math.max(0, maxSeen - num);
        }
        
        return ops;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ops = 0;
        int maxSeen = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < k) {
                ops += k - num;
            } else {
                maxSeen = max(maxSeen, num);
            }
            ops += max(0, maxSeen - num);
        }
        
        return ops;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ops = 0
        max_seen = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num < k:
                ops += k - num
            else:
                max_seen = max(max_seen, num)
            ops += max(0, max_seen - num)
        
        return ops
```
