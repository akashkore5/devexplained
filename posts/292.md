### Explanation:
The key to solving this problem is to understand the winning strategy for both players. By observing the game for different values of `n`, we can notice a pattern. If the number of stones in the heap is a multiple of 4, then the first player will lose; otherwise, the first player can always win by leaving a multiple of 4 stones for the second player.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def canWinNim(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n % 4 != 0
```
