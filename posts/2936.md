## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to count the number of blocks in an array where all numbers within a block are equal. We can achieve this by iterating through the array and comparing each element with its adjacent element to identify blocks of equal numbers.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter variable to 0 to store the count of equal number blocks.
2. Iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1.
3. For each element, compare it with the previous element.
4. If they are equal, continue checking the next element.
5. If they are not equal, increment the counter by 1 to indicate the end of the current block and start a new block.
6. After iterating through the array, the final count will be the number of equal number blocks.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
public int countBlocks(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int countBlocks(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Python
```python
def countBlocks(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
