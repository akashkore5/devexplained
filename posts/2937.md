**Explanation:**

To make three strings equal, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to delete characters from the right end of each string such that they become equal. We can approach this problem by iterating through the strings from right to left and comparing the characters at each position.

1. If the characters at the current position in all three strings are equal, we move to the next position.
2. If any two characters are different, we cannot make the strings equal, thus return -1.
3. If we encounter the end of one of the strings while the other strings still have characters remaining, we need to delete the remaining characters in those strings to make them equal. This will require the minimum number of operations.

By following this approach, we can determine if it is possible to make the strings equal and calculate the minimum number of operations required.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the longest string among s1, s2, and s3.
- Space complexity: O(1)

**Solutions:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int makeEqual(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        int i = s1.length() - 1, j = s2.length() - 1, k = s3.length() - 1;
        
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && k >= 0) {
            if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j) && s2.charAt(j) == s3.charAt(k)) {
                i--;
                j--;
                k--;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        
        return s1.length() - i - 1 + s2.length() - j - 1 + s3.length() - k - 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int makeEqual(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
        int i = s1.length() - 1, j = s2.length() - 1, k = s3.length() - 1;
        
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && k >= 0) {
            if (s1[i] == s2[j] && s2[j] == s3[k]) {
                i--;
                j--;
                k--;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        
        return s1.length() - i - 1 + s2.length() - j - 1 + s3.length() - k - 1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def makeEqual(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> int:
        i, j, k = len(s1) - 1, len(s2) - 1, len(s3) - 1
        
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0 and k >= 0:
            if s1[i] == s2[j] == s3[k]:
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
                k -= 1
            else:
                return -1
        
        return len(s1) - i - 1 + len(s2) - j - 1 + len(s3) - k - 1
