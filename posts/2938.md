### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and count the number of black balls that are to the left of their correct positions. The minimum number of steps required will be equal to this count, as each swap operation can move one black ball to the right. We can calculate this count by iterating through the string from left to right and keeping track of the number of black balls encountered.
 Solution:
```java
public int minSwaps(String s) {
    int blackCount = 0;
    int misplacedBlacks = 0;
    
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '1') {
            blackCount++;
        } else {
            misplacedBlacks += blackCount;
        }
    }
    
    return misplacedBlacks;
}
```

### C++ Solution:
```cpp
int minSwaps(string s) {
    int blackCount = 0;
    int misplacedBlacks = 0;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '1') {
            blackCount++;
        } else {
            misplacedBlacks += blackCount;
        }
    }
    
    return misplacedBlacks;
}
```

### Python Solution:
```python
def minSwaps(s: str) -> int:
    black_count = 0
    misplaced_blacks = 0
    
    for c in s:
        if c == '1':
            black_count += 1
        else:
            misplaced_blacks += black_count
    
    return misplaced_blacks
```
