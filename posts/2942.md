## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate through each word in the given array and check if the character `x` is present in that word. If the character is found, we add the index of that word to the result array.
Finally, we return the result array containing the indices of words that contain the character `x`.

- Initialize an empty array `result` to store the indices of words containing character `x`.
- Iterate through each word in the input array `words`.
- For each word, check if the character `x` is present in that word.
- If `x` is found in the word, add the index of that word to the `result` array.
- Return the `result` array containing the indices of words that contain the character `x`.

Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length of words in the input array.

Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of words in the input array.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int[] findWordsContainingChar(String[] words, char x) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].contains(String.valueOf(x))) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findWordsContainingChar(vector<string>& words, char x) {
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            if (words[i].find(x) != string::npos) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def find_words_containing_char(self, words: List[str], x: str) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if x in word:
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
```
