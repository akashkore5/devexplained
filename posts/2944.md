### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will iterate through the prices array and for each fruit, we will consider two scenarios - either we buy the fruit or we take it for free as a reward. We will maintain an array `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed to acquire fruits up to the current index. For each fruit, we update the `dp` array with the optimal cost.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a dp array of size n+1 where n is the length of the prices array.
2. Initialize dp[0] to 0 as we don't need any coins to acquire the first fruit.
3. Iterate from 1 to n:
   - For each fruit at index i, consider two scenarios:
     - Buy the fruit: cost[i] + dp[i-1]
     - Take the fruit for free as a reward: dp[j] where j is the index of the fruit we got for free
     - Update dp[i] with the minimum of the above two scenarios.
4. Return dp[n] which represents the minimum number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the length of the prices array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the prices array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minCoinsForFruits(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = prices[i-1] + dp[i-1];
            for (int j = 0; j < i-1; j++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j]);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCoinsForFruits(std::vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = prices[i-1] + dp[i-1];
            for (int j = 0; j < i-1; j++) {
                dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[j]);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCoinsForFruits(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [0] * (n+1)

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i] = prices[i-1] + dp[i-1]
            for j in range(i-1):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j])

        return dp[n]
```
