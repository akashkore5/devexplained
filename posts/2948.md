## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to store the elements in a sorted order. We iterate through the array and for each element, we try to find the smallest element within the limit range in the priority queue. If such an element is found, we swap it with the current element to make the array lexicographically smaller.

The algorithmic steps are as follows:
1. Initialize an empty priority queue sorted based on element value along with their indices.
2. Iterate through the array elements.
3. For each element, check the smallest element within the limit range in the priority queue.
4. If such an element exists, swap it with the current element.
5. Continue this process until no more swaps can be made.

At each step, we are trying to make the array lexicographically smaller by performing the allowed swaps. This way, we can obtain the lexicographically smallest array possible.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the input array nums. This is due to the iteration through the array and the operations on the priority queue.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n) to store the priority queue.

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] minArray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            pq.offer(new int[]{nums[i], i});
        }
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int diff = curr[0];
            int index = curr[1];
            
            for (int i = index + 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
                if (Math.abs(nums[i] - diff) <= limit) {
                    int temp = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = diff;
                    nums[index] = temp;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
