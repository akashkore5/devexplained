## Explanation:
To find the peaks in the mountain array, we iterate through the array checking each element against its neighbors. If an element is strictly greater than both its neighbors, it is a peak. We need to skip the first and last elements as they cannot be peaks.

Algorithm:
1. Iterate through the mountain array from index 1 to n-2.
2. For each element at index i, check if mountain[i] > mountain[i-1] and mountain[i] > mountain[i+1].
3. If the above condition is true, add the index i to the list of peaks.
4. Return the list of peak indices.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the mountain array.
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the space for the output list of peak indices.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findPeaks(int[] mountain) {
        List<Integer> peaks = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < mountain.length - 1; i++) {
            if (mountain[i] > mountain[i - 1] && mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1]) {
                peaks.add(i);
            }
        }
        return peaks;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findPeaks(vector<int>& mountain) {
        vector<int> peaks;
        for (int i = 1; i < mountain.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (mountain[i] > mountain[i - 1] && mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1]) {
                peaks.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return peaks;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeaks(self, mountain: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        peaks = []
        for i in range(1, len(mountain) - 1):
            if mountain[i] > mountain[i - 1] and mountain[i] > mountain[i + 1]:
                peaks.append(i)
        return peaks
```
