## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of coins that need to be added to the given array `coins` so that every integer in the range [1, target] is obtainable. We can approach this problem by iterating through the given coins and maintaining a reachable range. We keep track of the maximum reachable value using the current coins. If there is a gap between the maximum reachable value and the next coin value, we need to add a new coin at that gap to extend the reachable range.

1. Sort the given `coins` array.
2. Initialize `maxReach` as 0 to represent the maximum reachable value using the current coins.
3. For each coin in the sorted array:
   - If the current coin value is greater than `maxReach + 1`, we need to add a coin at the gap `maxReach + 1` to extend the reachable range.
   - Update `maxReach` to include the current coin value.
4. Return the total number of coins added to fill the gaps.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the number of coins.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minAdditionCoins(int[] coins, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(coins);
        int maxReach = 0;
        int addedCoins = 0;
        
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin > maxReach + 1) {
                addedCoins++;
                maxReach += maxReach + 1;
            } else {
                maxReach += coin;
            }
            
            if (maxReach >= target) {
                return addedCoins;
            }
        }
        
        while (maxReach < target) {
            addedCoins++;
            maxReach += maxReach + 1;
        }
        
        return addedCoins;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minAdditionCoins(std::vector<int>& coins, int target) {
        std::sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
        int maxReach = 0;
        int addedCoins = 0;
        
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin > maxReach + 1) {
                addedCoins++;
                maxReach += maxReach + 1;
            } else {
                maxReach += coin;
            }
            
            if (maxReach >= target) {
                return addedCoins;
            }
        }
        
        while (maxReach < target) {
            addedCoins++;
            maxReach += maxReach + 1;
        }
        
        return addedCoins;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minAdditionCoins(self, coins: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        coins.sort()
        maxReach = 0
        addedCoins = 0
        
        for coin in coins:
            if coin > maxReach + 1:
                addedCoins += 1
                maxReach += maxReach + 1
            else:
                maxReach += coin
            
            if maxReach >= target:
                return addedCoins
        
        while maxReach < target:
            addedCoins += 1
            maxReach += maxReach + 1
        
        return addedCoins
```
