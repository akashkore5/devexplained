## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible substrings of the given word and check if each substring is a complete substring according to the given conditions. We can achieve this by maintaining a count of characters in each substring and checking if the conditions are satisfied. We can use a sliding window approach to efficiently iterate through the substrings. 

The algorithm involves iterating through each character in the word and expanding a window to the right while keeping track of character frequencies. If the current window is a complete substring, we increment the count of complete substrings. We then shrink the window from the left side and continue the process until we have considered all substrings.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input word. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countCompleteSubstrings(String word, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            int[] freq = new int[26];
            for (int j = i; j < word.length(); j++) {
                int maxDiff = 0;
                for (int l = 0; l < 26; l++) {
                    if (freq[l] > 0) {
                        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(l - 'a'));
                    }
                }
                if (j - i + 1 == k && maxDiff <= 2) {
                    count++;
                }
                freq[word.charAt(j) - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteSubstrings(string word, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            vector<int> freq(26, 0);
            for (int j = i; j < word.length(); j++) {
                int maxDiff = 0;
                for (int l = 0; l < 26; l++) {
                    if (freq[l] > 0) {
                        maxDiff = max(maxDiff, abs(l - 'a'));
                    }
                }
                if (j - i + 1 == k && maxDiff <= 2) {
                    count++;
                }
                freq[word[j] - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countCompleteSubstrings(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(word)):
            freq = [0] * 26
            for j in range(i, len(word)):
                max_diff = 0
                for l in range(26):
                    if freq[l] > 0:
                        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(l - ord('a')))
                if j - i + 1 == k and max_diff <= 2:
                    count += 1
                freq[ord(word[j]) - ord('a')] += 1
        return count
