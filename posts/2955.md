### Explanation:

Given a string, we need to find the number of substrings where both the start and end characters are the same.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and consider it as the potential start of the substring. For each character, we then iterate through the rest of the string to find all substrings that have the same start and end character.

### Example:
Let's consider the input string "abcab".
1. For the character 'a' at index 0, we find 2 substrings with the same start and end character: "a" and "abca".
2. For the character 'b' at index 1, we find 1 substring: "b".
3. For the character 'c' at index 2, we find 1 substring: "c".
4. For the character 'a' at index 3, we find 1 substring: "a".

Total number of same-end substrings: 5

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countEndSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countEndSubstrings(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countEndSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    count += 1
        return count
```
