### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and compare each character with its adjacent characters. If we find almost-equal characters, we can change one of them to a different character to break the adjacency. We need to count the minimum number of operations needed to remove all adjacent almost-equal characters.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `operations` to count the number of operations needed.
2. Iterate through the string starting from the second character.
3. Compare the current character with the previous character:
   - If they are almost-equal, increment `operations` and change the current character to a different character.
4. Return the final value of `operations`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String word) {
        int operations = 0;
        char[] arr = word.toCharArray();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1] || Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) == 1) {
                operations++;
                arr[i] = 'a'; // Change to a different character
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string word) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); i++) {
            if (word[i] == word[i - 1] || abs(word[i] - word[i - 1]) == 1) {
                operations++;
                word[i] = 'a'; // Change to a different character
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, word: str) -> int:
        operations = 0
        arr = list(word)
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1] or abs(ord(arr[i]) - ord(arr[i - 1])) == 1:
                operations += 1
                arr[i] = 'a' # Change to a different character
        
        return operations
```
