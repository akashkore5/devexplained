## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array of battery percentages and simulate the testing process for each device. For each device, if its battery percentage is greater than 0, we increment the count of tested devices and decrease the battery percentage of all devices to the right by 1. We ensure that the battery percentage of each device never goes below 0.

We can implement this algorithm with a simple loop that updates the battery percentages accordingly. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of devices, and the space complexity is O(1).
```java
class Solution {
    public int countTestedDevices(int[] batteryPercentages) {
        int n = batteryPercentages.length;
        int testedDevices = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (batteryPercentages[i] > 0) {
                testedDevices++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    batteryPercentages[j] = Math.max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return testedDevices;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTestedDevices(vector<int>& batteryPercentages) {
        int n = batteryPercentages.size();
        int testedDevices = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (batteryPercentages[i] > 0) {
                testedDevices++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return testedDevices;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countTestedDevices(self, batteryPercentages: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(batteryPercentages)
        tested_devices = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if batteryPercentages[i] > 0:
                tested_devices += 1
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1)

        return tested_devices
```
