## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from left to right and keep track of the last index where each number occurred. We can use a hashmap to store this information. Then, for each index in the array, we can calculate the number of good partitions that end at that index by considering all possible partitions that end with the current number. Finally, we sum up the total number of good partitions over all indices.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a hashmap to store the last index of each number.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total number of good partitions.
3. Iterate through the array from left to right.
4. For each index, calculate the number of good partitions that end at that index by considering all possible partitions that end with the current number.
5. Update the total number of good partitions.
6. Return the total number of good partitions modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
**Space Complexity:** O(n), for the hashmap to store the last index of each number.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countGoodPartitions(int[] nums) {
        long mod = 1000000007;
        Map<Integer, Integer> lastIndices = new HashMap<>();
        long goodPartitions = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            int lastIndex = lastIndices.getOrDefault(num, -1);
            int partitions = i - lastIndex;
            goodPartitions += partitions;
            lastIndices.put(num, i);
        }
        
        return (int)(goodPartitions % mod);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodPartitions(vector<int>& nums) {
        long mod = 1000000007;
        unordered_map<int, int> lastIndices;
        long goodPartitions = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            int lastIndex = (lastIndices.find(num) != lastIndices.end()) ? lastIndices[num] : -1;
            int partitions = i - lastIndex;
            goodPartitions += partitions;
            lastIndices[num] = i;
        }
        
        return (int)(goodPartitions % mod);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countGoodPartitions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mod = 1000000007
        lastIndices = {}
        goodPartitions = 0
        
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            lastIndex = lastIndices.get(num, -1)
            partitions = i - lastIndex
            goodPartitions += partitions
            lastIndices[num] = i
        
        return int(goodPartitions % mod)
```
