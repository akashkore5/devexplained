### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. We iterate through the grid, calculating the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n^2, the actual sum of numbers in the grid, and keep track of the repeated and missing numbers.

- Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n^2 using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.
- Calculate the actual sum of numbers in the grid.
- Iterate through the grid:
  - For each number in the grid:
    - Check if the number has been seen before:
      - If yes, mark it as the repeated number.
      - If no, add it to the set of seen numbers.
- Calculate the missing number as the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum minus the repeated number.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as we iterate through the grid once. The space complexity is O(n^2) to store the set of seen numbers.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;
        int repeated = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (seen.contains(grid[i][j])) {
                    repeated = grid[i][j];
                } else {
                    seen.add(grid[i][j]);
                    actualSum += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int missing = expectedSum - actualSum + repeated;
        
        return new int[]{repeated, missing};
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;
        int repeated = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (seen.count(grid[i][j])) {
                    repeated = grid[i][j];
                } else {
                    seen.insert(grid[i][j]);
                    actualSum += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int missing = expectedSum - actualSum + repeated;
        
        return {repeated, missing};
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findErrorNums(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        seen = set()
        expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        actual_sum = 0
        repeated = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] in seen:
                    repeated = grid[i][j]
                else:
                    seen.add(grid[i][j])
                    actual_sum += grid[i][j]
        
        missing = expected_sum - actual_sum + repeated
        
        return [repeated, missing]
