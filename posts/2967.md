### Explanation:
To make the array equalindromic, we need to find the minimum cost to change all elements of the array to a palindromic number. We can achieve this by finding the median of the array and changing all elements to the median value.

1. Find the median of the array.
2. Calculate the total cost by taking the absolute difference between each element and the median and summing them up.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int median = nums[nums.length / 2];
        int cost = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            cost += Math.abs(num - median);
        }
        
        return cost;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int median = nums[nums.size() / 2];
        int cost = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            cost += abs(num - median);
        }
        
        return cost;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        median = nums[len(nums) // 2]
        cost = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            cost += abs(num - median)
            
        return cost
```
