## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the game by iterating through the array `nums`, removing the minimum element one by one, and appending them alternatively to the result array `arr`. We can use a priority queue to efficiently retrieve the minimum element in each round.

1. Initialize an empty priority queue to store the elements in `nums`.
2. Iterate through `nums`, and in each iteration:
   - Remove the minimum element from the priority queue.
   - Append the removed element to `arr`.
3. Return the resulting `arr`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we perform n insertions and n removals from the priority queue, each taking O(log n) time.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`, as we use a priority queue to store the elements.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] minNumberGame(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            pq.offer(num);
        }
        
        int[] arr = new int[nums.length];
        int i = 0;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            arr[i++] = pq.poll();
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> minNumberGame(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        std::vector<int> arr(nums.size());
        int i = 0;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            arr[i++] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minNumberGame(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        pq = nums
        heapq.heapify(pq)
        
        arr = [0] * len(nums)
        i = 0
        while pq:
            arr[i] = heapq.heappop(pq)
            i += 1
        
        return arr
```
