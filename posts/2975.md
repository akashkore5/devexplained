## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible sizes of squares starting from the largest possible size down to 1. For each size, we check if we can form a square of that size by removing fences. We can use binary search to find the maximum possible square size that can be formed.

1. Initialize the left pointer as 1 and the right pointer as the minimum of m and n.
2. Perform a binary search to find the maximum square size where we can form a square.
3. For each iteration of the binary search, we check if it's possible to form a square of that size by removing fences.
4. If a square can be formed, update the left pointer to mid + 1. Otherwise, update the right pointer to mid - 1.
5. Finally, return the maximum area of the square found modulo 10^9 + 7.

Time Complexity: O(log(min(m, n)) * (hFences.length + vFences.length))
Space Complexity: O(hFences.length + vFences.length)

        Arrays.sort(vFences);

        int left = 1, right = Math.min(m, n);
        int res = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
