## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate through the given items and sort them based on their price in descending order. Then we iterate through the sorted items and check if we can buy the current item by subtracting its price from the total money we have. If we can buy the item, we update the total money left. If we reach an item that we cannot buy, we return the price of that item as the result.

### Algorithm:
1. Sort the items based on their price in descending order.
2. Initialize a variable `moneyLeft` to store the total money we have.
3. Iterate through the sorted items:
   - If we can buy the current item, update `moneyLeft`.
   - If we cannot buy the current item, return its price as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(nlogn) where n is the number of items.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int mostExpensiveItem(int[] items, int money) {
        Arrays.sort(items);
        int moneyLeft = money;
        for (int item : items) {
            if (item <= moneyLeft) {
                moneyLeft -= item;
            } else {
                return item;
            }
        }
        return -1; // If no item is found that cannot be bought
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int mostExpensiveItem(std::vector<int>& items, int money) {
        std::sort(items.begin(), items.end(), std::greater<int>());
        int moneyLeft = money;
        for (int item : items) {
            if (item <= moneyLeft) {
                moneyLeft -= item;
            } else {
                return item;
            }
        }
        return -1; // If no item is found that cannot be bought
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def mostExpensiveItem(self, items: List[int], money: int) -> int:
        items.sort(reverse=True)
        moneyLeft = money
        for item in items:
            if item <= moneyLeft:
                moneyLeft -= item
            else:
                return item
        return -1  # If no item is found that cannot be bought
```
