### Explanation:
- We need to find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path in a binary tree.
- A consecutive sequence is a sequence of nodes from parent to child where the values of the nodes are consecutive integers.
- We can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree to track the consecutive sequence length.
- We pass the current node, the expected value of the next node in the sequence, and the current length of the consecutive sequence.
- If the current node's value is equal to the expected value, we increase the current length by 1.
- We recursively check the left and right children with the updated expected value and length, and return the maximum length from both branches.
- At each node, we compare the current length with the global maximum length.
:
```java
class Solution {
    int maxLen = 0;
    
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        dfs(root, root.val, 0);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode node, int expected, int length) {
        if (node == null) return;
        
        if (node.val == expected) {
            length++;
        } else {
            length = 1;
        }
        
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, length);
        
        dfs(node.left, node.val + 1, length);
        dfs(node.right, node.val + 1, length);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        dfs(root, root->val, 0, maxLen);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    void dfs(TreeNode* node, int expected, int length, int& maxLen) {
        if (!node) return;
        
        if (node->val == expected) {
            length++;
        } else {
            length = 1;
        }
        
        maxLen = max(maxLen, length);
        
        dfs(node->left, node->val + 1, length, maxLen);
        dfs(node->right, node->val + 1, length, maxLen);
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.maxLen = 0
        
        def dfs(node, expected, length):
            if not node:
                return
            
            if node.val == expected:
                length += 1
            else:
                length = 1
            
            self.maxLen = max(self.maxLen, length)
            
            dfs(node.left, node.val + 1, length)
            dfs(node.right, node.val + 1, length)
        
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        dfs(root, root.val, 0)
        return self.maxLen
