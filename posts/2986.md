## Explanation:
To find the third transaction in a given list of transactions, we can iterate through the list and keep track of the number of transactions seen so far. Whenever we encounter a new transaction, we increment the count. Once the count reaches 3, we return that transaction. If there are less than 3 transactions in the list, we return null.

- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of transactions in the list.
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
public String findThirdTransaction(String[] transactions) {
    int count = 0;
    String thirdTransaction = null;
    
    for (String transaction : transactions) {
        if (count == 2) {
            thirdTransaction = transaction;
            break;
        }
        
        count++;
    }
    
    return thirdTransaction;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string findThirdTransaction(vector<string>& transactions) {
    int count = 0;
    string thirdTransaction = "";
    
    for (string transaction : transactions) {
        if (count == 2) {
            thirdTransaction = transaction;
            break;
        }
        
        count++;
    }
    
    return thirdTransaction;
}
```

### Python
```python
def findThirdTransaction(transactions):
    count = 0
    thirdTransaction = None
    
    for transaction in transactions:
        if count == 2:
            thirdTransaction = transaction
            break
        
        count += 1
    
    return thirdTransaction
```
