### Explanation:
To find expensive cities, we can iterate through the given list of cities and their prices, keeping track of the highest price seen so far. We will also maintain a set to store the names of the expensive cities. If we encounter a price higher than the current highest price, we update the highest price and update the set of expensive cities.

1. Initialize a variable `maxPrice` to store the highest price seen so far.
2. Initialize an empty set `expensiveCities` to store the names of expensive cities.
3. Iterate through the list of cities and their prices.
4. If the price is higher than `maxPrice`, update `maxPrice` and clear `expensiveCities`.
5. Add the current city to `expensiveCities`.
6. Return the set `expensiveCities`.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public Set<String> findExpensiveCities(List<String> cities, List<Integer> prices) {
        int maxPrice = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        Set<String> expensiveCities = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices.get(i) > maxPrice) {
                maxPrice = prices.get(i);
                expensiveCities.clear();
                expensiveCities.add(cities.get(i));
            } else if (prices.get(i) == maxPrice) {
                expensiveCities.add(cities.get(i));
            }
        }

        return expensiveCities;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_set<std::string> findExpensiveCities(std::vector<std::string>& cities, std::vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxPrice = INT_MIN;
        std::unordered_set<std::string> expensiveCities;

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > maxPrice) {
                maxPrice = prices[i];
                expensiveCities.clear();
                expensiveCities.insert(cities[i]);
            } else if (prices[i] == maxPrice) {
                expensiveCities.insert(cities[i]);
            }
        }

        return expensiveCities;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findExpensiveCities(self, cities: List[str], prices: List[int]) -> Set[str]:
        max_price = float('-inf')
        expensive_cities = set()

        for city, price in zip(cities, prices):
            if price > max_price:
                max_price = price
                expensive_cities.clear()
                expensive_cities.add(city)
            elif price == max_price:
                expensive_cities.add(city)

        return expensive_cities
```
