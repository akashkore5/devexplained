## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the performance scores of each student. We will iterate through the given array of scores and calculate the overall performance of the class based on the given rules. Finally, we will return the performance of the class.

Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap to store the performance scores of each student.
2. Initialize a variable `classPerformance` to store the overall performance of the class.
3. Iterate through the given array of scores:
   - If the current score is less than 60, increment the performance score by 1.
   - If the current score is between 60 and 70 (inclusive), increment the performance score by 2.
   - If the current score is between 70 and 80 (inclusive), increment the performance score by 3.
   - If the current score is greater than or equal to 80, increment the performance score by 4.
4. Return the overall performance of the class.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of students.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the hashmap.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateClassPerformance(int[] scores) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> performanceMap = new HashMap<>();
        int classPerformance = 0;
        
        for (int score : scores) {
            int performance = 0;
            if (score < 60) {
                performance = 1;
            } else if (score >= 60 && score < 70) {
                performance = 2;
            } else if (score >= 70 && score < 80) {
                performance = 3;
            } else {
                performance = 4;
            }
            
            classPerformance += performance;
            performanceMap.put(score, performance);
        }
        
        return classPerformance;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int calculateClassPerformance(vector<int>& scores) {
        unordered_map<int, int> performanceMap;
        int classPerformance = 0;
        
        for (int score : scores) {
            int performance = 0;
            if (score < 60) {
                performance = 1;
            } else if (score >= 60 && score < 70) {
                performance = 2;
            } else if (score >= 70 && score < 80) {
                performance = 3;
            } else {
                performance = 4;
            }
            
            classPerformance += performance;
            performanceMap[score] = performance;
        }
        
        return classPerformance;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def calculateClassPerformance(self, scores: List[int]) -> int:
        performance_map = {}
        class_performance = 0
        
        for score in scores:
            performance = 0
            if score < 60:
                performance = 1
            elif 60 <= score < 70:
                performance = 2
            elif 70 <= score < 80:
                performance = 3
            else:
                performance = 4
                
            class_performance += performance
            performance_map[score] = performance
            
        return class_performance
