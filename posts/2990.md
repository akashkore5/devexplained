## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the given list of loans and count the number of occurrences of each loan type. We can use a hashmap to store the loan types as keys and their counts as values. Finally, we return the hashmap containing the counts of each loan type.

- Create a hashmap to store the counts of loan types.
- Iterate through the list of loans, incrementing the count for each loan type in the hashmap.
- Return the hashmap containing the counts of each loan type.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of loans in the input list.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) to store the hashmap of loan types.
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public Map<String, Integer> countLoanTypes(List<String> loans) {
        Map<String, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String loan : loans) {
            counts.put(loan, counts.getOrDefault(loan, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return counts;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> countLoanTypes(std::vector<std::string>& loans) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> counts;
        
        for (const auto& loan : loans) {
            counts[loan]++;
        }
        
        return counts;
    }
};
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def count_loan_types(self, loans: List[str]) -> dict:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        
        for loan in loans:
            counts[loan] += 1
        
        return dict(counts)
```
