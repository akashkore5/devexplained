### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of purchases and calculate the total amount spent on Fridays. We can keep track of the total amount spent on each day of the week and return the sum of the amounts spent on Fridays.

- Initialize a variable `totalFridayAmount` to 0 to keep track of the total amount spent on Fridays.
- Iterate through the list of purchases.
- For each purchase, check if it was made on a Friday (assuming Monday is the first day of the week).
- If the purchase was made on a Friday, add the purchase amount to `totalFridayAmount`.
- Finally, return `totalFridayAmount`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of purchases in the list.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int fridayPurchases(int[] purchases) {
        int totalFridayAmount = 0;
        
        for (int purchase : purchases) {
            if (purchase % 7 == 4) { // Assuming Monday is the first day of the week
                totalFridayAmount += purchase;
            }
        }
        
        return totalFridayAmount;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int fridayPurchases(vector<int>& purchases) {
        int totalFridayAmount = 0;
        
        for (int purchase : purchases) {
            if (purchase % 7 == 4) { // Assuming Monday is the first day of the week
                totalFridayAmount += purchase;
            }
        }
        
        return totalFridayAmount;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def fridayPurchases(self, purchases: List[int]) -> int:
        totalFridayAmount = 0
        
        for purchase in purchases:
            if purchase % 7 == 4:  # Assuming Monday is the first day of the week
                totalFridayAmount += purchase
        
        return totalFridayAmount
```
