### Explanation:
This problem asks us to find the maximum sum of viewer counts "turned into" streamer counts. We can approach this problem using dynamic programming. We can view this problem as a knapsack problem where we have items (viewers) with weights (viewer counts) and values (streamer counts). Our goal is to maximize the value while keeping the total weight within a given limit.

We can create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved using the first `i` viewers and having a total viewer count of exactly `j`. We can fill out this array iteratively by considering each viewer and either including or excluding them in our calculation.

At the end, the maximum value would be present in `dp[N][S]`, where `N` is the total number of viewers and `S` is the total sum of viewer counts.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxViewerTurnedStreamers(int[] viewers, int[] streamers) {
        int N = viewers.length;
        int S = 0;
        for (int viewer : viewers) {
            S += viewer;
        }

        int[][] dp = new int[N + 1][S + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= S; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; // Don't include viewer i
                if (j >= viewers[i - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - viewers[i - 1]] + streamers[i - 1]); // Include viewer i
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[N][S];
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxViewerTurnedStreamers(std::vector<int>& viewers, std::vector<int>& streamers) {
        int N = viewers.size();
        int S = 0;
        for (int viewer : viewers) {
            S += viewer;
        }

        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(S + 1, 0));

        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= S; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; // Don't include viewer i
                if (j >= viewers[i - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - viewers[i - 1]] + streamers[i - 1]); // Include viewer i
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[N][S];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def max_viewer_turned_streamers(self, viewers, streamers):
        N = len(viewers)
        S = sum(viewers)

        dp = [[0] * (S + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            for j in range(S + 1):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]  # Don't include viewer i
                if j >= viewers[i - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - viewers[i - 1]] + streamers[i - 1])  # Include viewer i

        return dp[N][S]
