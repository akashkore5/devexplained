## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a slightly modified approach to find the longest increasing subsequence. We will create an array `dp` to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. For each element at index `i`, we iterate through all previous elements to find the maximum length ending at index `i`.

The time complexity of this dynamic programming approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input array. However, we can optimize this solution to run in O(n log(n)) time complexity using a binary search-based approach.

The optimized algorithm involves maintaining a separate array `tails` which will store the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences with length `i+1`. We iterate through the input array and update the `tails` array based on the current element's value. The length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the length of the `tails` array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] tails = new int[n];
        int len = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int i = 0, j = len;
            while (i < j) {
                int mid = i + (j - i) / 2;
                if (tails[mid] < num) {
                    i = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    j = mid;
                }
            }
            tails[i] = num;
            if (i == len) {
                len++;
            }
        }
        
        return len;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> tails(n);
        int len = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int i = 0, j = len;
            while (i < j) {
                int mid = i + (j - i) / 2;
                if (tails[mid] < num) {
                    i = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    j = mid;
                }
            }
            tails[i] = num;
            if (i == len) {
                len++;
            }
        }
        
        return len;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        tails = [0] * n
        length = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            i, j = 0, length
            while i < j:
                mid = i + (j - i) // 2
                if tails[mid] < num:
                    i = mid + 1
                else:
                    j = mid
            tails[i] = num
            if i == length:
                length += 1
        
        return length
```
