### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to capture the black queen with the given white rook and white bishop positions. We can achieve this by simulating the moves of the white rook and bishop to check if they can capture the queen within the minimum possible moves.

1. Calculate the minimum moves needed for the white rook to capture the queen:
   - Check if the queen is in the same row or column as the white rook. If so, the rook can capture the queen in 1 move by moving to the queen's row or column.
   - Otherwise, the rook needs 2 moves to capture the queen by moving to the queen's row first and then to the queen's column.

2. Calculate the minimum moves needed for the white bishop to capture the queen:
   - Check if the queen is on the same diagonal as the white bishop. If so, the bishop can capture the queen in 1 move by moving to the queen's position.
   - If the queen is not on the same diagonal, the bishop cannot capture the queen.

3. Return the minimum of the moves required by the rook and the bishop to capture the queen.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMovesToCaptureTheQueen(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
        int rookMoves = (a == e || b == f) ? 1 : 2;
        int bishopMoves = (Math.abs(a - e) == Math.abs(b - f)) ? 1 : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        return Math.min(rookMoves, bishopMoves);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToCaptureTheQueen(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
        int rookMoves = (a == e || b == f) ? 1 : 2;
        int bishopMoves = (abs(a - e) == abs(b - f)) ? 1 : INT_MAX;
        return min(rookMoves, bishopMoves);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minMovesToCaptureTheQueen(self, a: int, b: int, c: int, d: int, e: int, f: int) -> int:
        rook_moves = 1 if a == e or b == f else 2
        bishop_moves = 1 if abs(a - e) == abs(b - f) else float('inf')
        return min(rook_moves, bishop_moves)
```
