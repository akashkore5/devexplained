### Explanation:

We can approach this problem by iterating through both arrays and counting the occurrences of each element. Then, we can remove the elements with the highest occurrences until we have removed `n / 2` elements from each array. Finally, we can insert the remaining elements into a set and return the size of the set.

Here is a step-by-step approach:
1. Iterate through both arrays and count the occurrences of each element.
2. Remove the elements with the highest occurrences until `n / 2` elements are removed from each array.
3. Insert the remaining elements into a set.
4. Return the size of the set as the maximum possible size after removals.

Time complexity:
- Counting occurrences: O(n)
- Removing elements: O(n)
- Inserting into a set: O(n)
Overall time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity:
- Storing occurrences: O(n)
- Storing elements in a set: O(n)
Overall space complexity: O(n)

        int targetRemovals = nums1.length / 2;
