## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest number whose accumulated price (total price from 1 to that number) is less than or equal to `k`, where the price of a number is calculated based on the count of set bits at positions `x`, `2x`, `3x`, etc., in its binary representation.

We can use binary search to find the greatest cheap number. The key observation is that the accumulated price is a non-decreasing function of `num`. We can perform a binary search on the possible values of `num` to find the greatest number within the given constraints.

1. Initially, we set our search range to be from 1 to `k` because the accumulated price of a number `n` is at most `log2(n)`.
2. In each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the accumulated price for the mid number and update our search range accordingly.
3. We continue this process until we find the greatest cheap number within the constraints.

The time complexity of this approach is O(log N) where N is the search space (k in this case), and the space complexity is O(1).
```java
class Solution {
    public int findGreatestNumber(int k, int x) {
        long left = 1;
        long right = k;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left + 1) / 2;
            if (calculateAccumulatedPrice(mid, x) <= k) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return (int)left;
    }
    
    private long calculateAccumulatedPrice(long num, int x) {
        long price = 0;
        long factor = 1;
        
        while (num > 0) {
            long count = num / 2;
            long remainder = num % 2;
            price += count * factor;
            if (remainder > 0) {
                price += Math.min(remainder, 1L << x);
            }
            num /= 2;
            factor *= 2;
            x++;
        }
        
        return price;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findGreatestNumber(int k, int x) {
        long left = 1;
        long right = k;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left + 1) / 2;
            if (calculateAccumulatedPrice(mid, x) <= k) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return (int)left;
    }
    
    long calculateAccumulatedPrice(long num, int x) {
        long price = 0;
        long factor = 1;
        
        while (num > 0) {
            long count = num / 2;
            long remainder = num % 2;
            price += count * factor;
            if (remainder > 0) {
                price += min(remainder, 1L << x);
            }
            num /= 2;
            factor *= 2;
            x++;
        }
        
        return price;
    }
