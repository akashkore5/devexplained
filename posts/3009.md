## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a sweep line algorithm. We can iterate through each point on the chart and keep track of the number of active segments at each point. We can then calculate the number of intersections based on the number of active segments at each point.

Here are the steps:
1. Create an array of events where each event represents the start and end points of a segment on the chart.
2. Sort the events based on their x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, prioritize the start event over the end event.
3. Initialize a variable `activeSegments` to keep track of the number of active segments.
4. Iterate through each event in the sorted array:
   - If the event is a start point, increment `activeSegments`.
   - If the event is an end point, decrement `activeSegments`.
   - Calculate the number of intersections at this point as `activeSegments * (activeSegments - 1) / 2` and add it to the total number of intersections.
5. Return the total number of intersections.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of segments/events.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the events.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxIntersections(int[][] segments) {
        int n = segments.length;
        
        int[][] events = new int[2 * n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            events[2 * i] = new int[]{segments[i][0], 1};
            events[2 * i + 1] = new int[]{segments[i][1], -1};
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        
        int activeSegments = 0;
        int intersections = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            activeSegments += events[i][1];
            intersections += activeSegments * (activeSegments - 1) / 2;
        }
        
        return intersections;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIntersections(vector<vector<int>>& segments) {
        int n = segments.size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> events(2 * n, vector<int>(2));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            events[2 * i] = {segments[i][0], 1};
            events[2 * i + 1] = {segments[i][1], -1};
        }
        
        sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] < b[1] : a[0] < b[0];
        });
        
        int activeSegments = 0;
        int intersections = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            activeSegments += events[i][1];
            intersections += activeSegments * (activeSegments - 1) / 2;
        }
        
        return intersections;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxIntersections(self, segments: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(segments)
        
        events = [[0, 0] for _ in range(2 * n)]
        for i in range(n):
            events[2 * i] = [segments[i][0], 1]
            events[2 * i + 1] = [segments[i][1], -1]
        
        events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        
        activeSegments = 0
        intersections = 0
        for event in events:
            activeSegments += event[1]
            intersections += activeSegments * (activeSegments - 1) // 2
        
        return intersections
