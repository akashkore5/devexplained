### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of pushes needed to type a given word after remapping the keys on a telephone keypad. We can achieve this by calculating the distance between the current character and the target character on the keypad for each character in the word.

1. Create a mapping of characters to the keys on the keypad.
2. For each character in the word, calculate the minimum number of pushes needed to reach the target key from the current key.
3. Accumulate the total number of pushes for all characters in the word.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the word
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minPushes(String word) {
        int[] keyMapping = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int totalPushes = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = word.charAt(i);
            int targetKey = currentChar - 'a' + 2; // Mapping a to key 2
            int currentKey = keyMapping[currentChar - 'a'];
            
            int distance = Math.min(Math.abs(targetKey - currentKey), 9 - Math.abs(targetKey - currentKey)); // Calculate the minimum distance between keys
            totalPushes += distance;
        }
        
        return totalPushes;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPushes(string word) {
        int keyMapping[26] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
        int totalPushes = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = word[i];
            int targetKey = currentChar - 'a' + 2; // Mapping a to key 2
            int currentKey = keyMapping[currentChar - 'a'];
            
            int distance = min(abs(targetKey - currentKey), 9 - abs(targetKey - currentKey)); // Calculate the minimum distance between keys
            totalPushes += distance;
        }
        
        return totalPushes;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
        key_mapping = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        total_pushes = 0
        
        for char in word:
            target_key = ord(char) - ord('a') + 2
            current_key = key_mapping[ord(char) - ord('a')]
            
            distance = min(abs(target_key - current_key), 9 - abs(target_key - current_key)) # Calculate the minimum distance between keys
            total_pushes += distance
        
        return total_pushes
