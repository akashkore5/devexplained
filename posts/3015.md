### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible pairs of houses and calculate the minimum number of streets needed to travel between them. For each pair, we calculate the distance using the street connecting houses x and y, and then determine the minimum number of streets required to reach one house from the other. We maintain a count of pairs for each distance k.

1. Iterate through all pairs of houses.
2. Calculate the distance between the houses using the street connecting x and y.
3. Determine the minimum streets required to reach one house from the other.
4. Update the count of pairs for each distance k.
5. Return the counts as the result array.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of houses.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the result array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countPairs(int n, int x, int y) {
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int distance = Math.min(Math.abs(x - i) + Math.abs(y - j) + 1, Math.abs(y - i) + Math.abs(x - j) + 1);
                result[distance - 1]++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countPairs(int n, int x, int y) {
        vector<int> result(n, 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                int distance = min(abs(x - i) + abs(y - j) + 1, abs(y - i) + abs(x - j) + 1);
                result[distance - 1]++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n: int, x: int, y: int) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                distance = min(abs(x - i) + abs(y - j) + 1, abs(y - i) + abs(x - j) + 1)
                result[distance - 1] += 1
        
        return result
```
