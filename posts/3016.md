## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the given word after remapping the keys. We can achieve this by iterating through the characters of the word and calculating the cost of typing each character using the remapped keypad. We will then sum up these costs to get the total minimum number of pushes required.

1. Create a mapping of characters to keys on the remapped keypad.
2. Iterate through each character in the word and calculate the cost of typing that character using the remapped keypad.
3. Sum up these costs to get the total minimum number of pushes required.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the word, as we iterate through each character only once. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOfPushes(String word) {
        int[] keypad = new int[]{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int cost = 0;
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            int key = keypad[index % 8];
            int presses = (index / 8) + 1;
            cost += presses;
        }
        return cost;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOfPushes(string word) {
        vector<int> keypad = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int cost = 0;
        for (char c : word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            int key = keypad[index % 8];
            int presses = (index / 8) + 1;
            cost += presses;
        }
        return cost;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minNumberOfPushes(self, word: str) -> int:
        keypad = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        cost = 0
        for c in word:
            index = ord(c) - ord('a')
            key = keypad[index % 8]
            presses = (index // 8) + 1
            cost += presses
        return cost
