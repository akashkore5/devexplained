### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and count the number of times the user had to change the key based on the conditions provided. We need to compare each character with the previous character and check if a key change is required. We can ignore cases where caps lock or shift is used as they do not count as a key change.

- Initialize a variable `changes` to 0 to keep track of the number of key changes.
- Iterate through the string starting from index 1.
- For each character, check if it is different from the previous character and both characters are not the same letter with different cases.
- If the above condition is met, increment the `changes` count.
- Finally, return the `changes` count as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfChangingKeys(String s) {
        int changes = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1) && Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(i)) != Character.toLowerCase(s.charAt(i - 1))) {
                changes++;
            }
        }
        return changes;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfChangingKeys(string s) {
        int changes = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != s[i - 1] && tolower(s[i]) != tolower(s[i - 1])) {
                changes++;
            }
        }
        return changes;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfChangingKeys(self, s: str) -> int:
        changes = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] != s[i - 1] and s[i].lower() != s[i - 1].lower():
                changes += 1
        return changes
```
