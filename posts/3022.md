## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of the remaining elements of the array after applying at most k operations. We can achieve this by iteratively reducing the array using the given operation. The idea is to keep reducing the array until it is not possible to perform any more operations or until we have performed k operations. 

We can observe that the operation of bitwise AND between two numbers always results in a number that is less than or equal to the smaller number of the two. So, when we perform the operation on two adjacent elements, the result will always be less than or equal to the minimum of the two elements. 

Therefore, to minimize the OR of the remaining elements, we need to minimize the elements in the array as much as possible. We can achieve this by iteratively reducing the array by applying the operation on adjacent elements with the smallest possible value until we have performed k operations or until we can no longer perform any operations.

After reducing the array using this approach, the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of the remaining elements will be the minimum value remaining in the array.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minElements(int[] nums, int k) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1 && k > 0; i++) {
            int smaller = Math.min(nums[i], nums[i + 1]);
            int newValue = nums[i] & nums[i + 1];
            nums[i] = smaller;
            nums[i + 1] = newValue;
            k--;
        }
        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minElements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int minVal = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1 && k > 0; i++) {
            int smaller = min(nums[i], nums[i + 1]);
            int newValue = nums[i] & nums[i + 1];
            nums[i] = smaller;
            nums[i + 1] = newValue;
            k--;
        }
        for (int num : nums) {
            minVal = min(minVal, num);
        }
        return minVal;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minElements(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        min_val = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if k == 0:
                break
            smaller = min(nums[i], nums[i + 1])
            new_value = nums[i] & nums[i + 1]
            nums[i] = smaller
            nums[i + 1] = new_value
            k -= 1
        min_val = min(nums)
        return min_val
```
