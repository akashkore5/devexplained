## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the ant based on the given array of integers. We will keep track of the ant's position and count the number of times it returns to the boundary. We iterate through the array, moving the ant left or right based on the value of the current element. If the ant reaches the boundary after moving, we increment the count of boundary returns.

- Start the ant at position 0.
- Iterate through the array:
  - If the current element is negative, move the ant left by the absolute value of the element.
  - If the current element is positive, move the ant right by the value of the element.
  - Check if the ant is at the boundary after moving.
- Return the count of boundary returns.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array.
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int antOnTheBoundary(int[] nums) {
        int position = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < 0) {
                position -= Math.abs(num);
            } else {
                position += num;
            }
            
            if (position == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int antOnTheBoundary(vector<int>& nums) {
        int position = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < 0) {
                position -= abs(num);
            } else {
                position += num;
            }
            
            if (position == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def ant_on_the_boundary(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        position = 0
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num < 0:
                position -= abs(num)
            else:
                position += num
            
            if position == 0:
                count += 1
        
        return count
