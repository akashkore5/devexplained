### Explanation:
The problem can be solved by simulating the process of removing and adding characters to the string `word`. We can keep track of the current state of `word` and after each second, we remove the first `k` characters and add any `k` characters to the end. We continue this process until `word` reverts to its initial state.

To find the minimum time required, we can iterate through the possible durations from 1 to `word.length()` and check if `word` reverts to its initial state within that duration. The minimum time will be the first duration where `word` reverts to its initial state.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the word. This is because for each possible duration, we perform removal and addition operations on the word.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the word. This is because we are storing the modified versions of the word in each iteration.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToType(String word, int k) {
        for (int time = 1; time <= word.length(); time++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(word);
            int i = 0;
            while (i < word.length()) {
                if (sb.substring(0, k).equals(word.substring(i, i + k))) {
                    sb.delete(0, k);
                    i += k;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (sb.length() == 0) {
                return time;
            }
            word = word.substring(k) + word.substring(0, k);
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToType(string word, int k) {
        for (int time = 1; time <= word.length(); time++) {
            string temp = word;
            int i = 0;
            while (i < word.length()) {
                if (temp.substr(0, k) == word.substr(i, k)) {
                    temp = temp.substr(k);
                    i += k;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (temp.empty()) {
                return time;
            }
            word = word.substr(k) + word.substr(0, k);
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        for time in range(1, len(word) + 1):
            temp = word
            i = 0
            while i < len(word):
                if temp[:k] == word[i:i + k]:
                    temp = temp[k:]
                    i += k
                else:
                    break
            if not temp:
                return time
            word = word[k:] + word[:k]
        return -1
