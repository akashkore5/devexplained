## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of removing the first `k` characters and adding any `k` characters to the end of the word at each second until the word reverts to its initial state. We will keep track of the current state of the word at each step and check if it matches the initial word state.

We can optimize the process by observing that if the word does revert to its initial state, it must be a rotation of the initial word. Therefore, we can concatenate the initial word with itself and find the longest prefix that is a suffix in this concatenated word. This will give us the length of the shortest rotation that reverts the word to its initial state.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the word, and the space complexity is O(n) to store the concatenated word.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToType(String word, int k) {
        String initialWord = word;
        word += word;
        int n = word.length();
        int[] lps = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate the longest prefix that is also a suffix
        int len = 0, i = 1;
        while (i < n) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == word.charAt(len)) {
                len++;
                lps[i] = len;
                i++;
            } else {
                if (len != 0) {
                    len = lps[len - 1];
                } else {
                    lps[i] = 0;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int repeatLength = n - lps[n - 1];
        return repeatLength / initialWord.length();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToType(string word, int k) {
        string initialWord = word;
        word += word;
        int n = word.length();
        vector<int> lps(n, 0);
        
        // Calculate the longest prefix that is also a suffix
        int len = 0, i = 1;
        while (i < n) {
            if (word[i] == word[len]) {
                len++;
                lps[i] = len;
                i++;
            } else {
                if (len != 0) {
                    len = lps[len - 1];
                } else {
                    lps[i] = 0;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int repeatLength = n - lps[n - 1];
        return repeatLength / initialWord.length();
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToType(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        initial_word = word
        word += word
        n = len(word)
        lps = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate the longest prefix that is also a suffix
        len, i = 0, 1
        while i < n:
            if word[i] == word[len]:
                len += 1
                lps[i] = len
                i += 1
            else:
                if len != 0:
                    len = lps[len - 1]
                else:
                    lps[i] = 0
                    i += 1
        
        repeat_length = n - lps[n - 1]
        return repeat_length // len(initial_word)
