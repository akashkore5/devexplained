### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can construct palindrome strings by swapping characters between different words. The key insight is that we can only create palindromes if the characters occur in pairs. Therefore, we need to focus on creating pairs of characters.

1. Count the frequency of characters in each word.
2. For each character, pair up as many characters as possible to form palindromes.
3. After pairing up all possible characters, if there are any unpaired characters, we can use them to form a single character palindrome.

Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word.
Space Complexity: O(m) where m is the maximum length of a word.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPalindromes(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        int[] freq = new int[26]; // array to store character frequencies
        
        for (String word : words) {
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                freq[c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        int pairs = 0;
        int singles = 0;
        
        for (int f : freq) {
            pairs += f / 2;
            singles += f % 2;
        }
        
        return Math.min(n, pairs) + (singles > 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPalindromes(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        vector<int> freq(26, 0); // vector to store character frequencies
        
        for (string word : words) {
            for (char c : word) {
                freq[c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        int pairs = 0;
        int singles = 0;
        
        for (int f : freq) {
            pairs += f / 2;
            singles += f % 2;
        }
        
        return min(n, pairs) + (singles > 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPalindromes(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 26  # list to store character frequencies
        
        for word in words:
            for c in word:
                freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        n = len(words)
        pairs = sum(f // 2 for f in freq)
        singles = sum(f % 2 for f in freq)
        
        return min(n, pairs) + (1 if singles > 0 else 0)
