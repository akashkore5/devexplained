## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input array to count the occurrences of each unique element. Then, we can try to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed with the same score by calculating the score that can be achieved by each unique element.

We can sort the occurrences of elements in descending order and try to find the maximum number of operations. We can iterate through the occurrences and calculate the score that can be achieved by pairing the current element with the next unique element. If the current element's count is odd, we can pair it with itself and decrement its count by one to make it even.

The maximum number of operations with the same score will be the sum of the counts of the elements divided by 2 because each operation involves two elements.

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfOperations(int[] nums) {
        int[] counts = new int[1001];
        for (int num : nums) {
            counts[num]++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(counts);
        
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1000; i > 0; i--) {
            while (counts[i] > 0) {
                if (counts[i] % 2 == 0) {
                    operations += counts[i] / 2;
                    counts[i] = 0;
                } else {
                    operations += counts[i] / 2;
                    counts[i] = 1;
                    counts[i - 1]--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::vector<int> counts(1001, 0);
        for (int num : nums) {
            counts[num]++;
        }
        std::sort(counts.begin(), counts.end());
        
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1000; i > 0; i--) {
            while (counts[i] > 0) {
                if (counts[i] % 2 == 0) {
                    operations += counts[i] / 2;
                    counts[i] = 0;
                } else {
                    operations += counts[i] / 2;
                    counts[i] = 1;
                    counts[i - 1]--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counts = [0] * 1001
        for num in nums:
            counts[num] += 1
        counts.sort()
        
        operations = 0
        for i in range(1000, 0, -1):
            while counts[i] > 0:
                if counts[i] % 2 == 0:
                    operations += counts[i] // 2
                    counts[i] = 0
                else:
                    operations += counts[i] // 2
                    counts[i] = 1
                    counts[i - 1] -= 1
        
        return operations
```
