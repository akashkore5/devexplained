### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all pairs of words and check if one word is a prefix and suffix of the other word. We can do this by checking if the second word starts with the first word and ends with the first word.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of valid index pairs.
2. Iterate through all pairs of words using two nested loops.
3. For each pair of words, check if the first word is a prefix and suffix of the second word.
4. If the condition is met, increment the `count`.
5. Return the final `count` as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of words in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrefixAndSuffixPairs(String[] words) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
                if (words[j].startsWith(words[i]) && words[j].endsWith(words[i])) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrefixAndSuffixPairs(vector<string>& words) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < words.size(); j++) {
                if (words[j].find(words[i]) == 0 && words[j].rfind(words[i]) == words[j].size() - words[i].size()) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countPrefixAndSuffixPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(words)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
                if words[j].startswith(words[i]) and words[j].endswith(words[i]):
                    count += 1
        return count
```
