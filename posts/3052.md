### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We can sort the items based on their value-to-weight ratio and then start picking items starting from the one with the highest ratio until we exceed the weight limit. This ensures that we pick the items with the maximum value possible.

1. Sort the items based on their value-to-weight ratio in descending order.
2. Initialize a variable `maxValue = 0` to keep track of the total value of picked items.
3. Iterate through the sorted items and pick items until the weight limit is exceeded.
4. Calculate the total value of the picked items.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - Sorting the items based on their ratio.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space is used.

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Item {
    int weight;
    int value;

    public Item(int weight, int value) {
        this.weight = weight;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

public class MaximizeItems {
    public static int maximizeItems(Item[] items, int weightLimit) {
        Arrays.sort(items, (a, b) -> Double.compare((double) b.value / b.weight, (double) a.value / a.weight));
        int maxValue = 0;
        int currentWeight = 0;

        for (Item item : items) {
            if (currentWeight + item.weight <= weightLimit) {
                maxValue += item.value;
                currentWeight += item.weight;
            } else {
                int remainingWeight = weightLimit - currentWeight;
                maxValue += item.value * ((double) remainingWeight / item.weight);
                break;
            }
        }

        return maxValue;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Item {
    int weight;
    int value;
};

bool compareItems(Item a, Item b) {
    return (double)a.value / a.weight > (double)b.value / b.weight;
}

int maximizeItems(std::vector<Item>& items, int weightLimit) {
    std::sort(items.begin(), items.end(), compareItems);

    int maxValue = 0;
    int currentWeight = 0;

    for (Item& item : items) {
        if (currentWeight + item.weight <= weightLimit) {
            maxValue += item.value;
            currentWeight += item.weight;
        } else {
            int remainingWeight = weightLimit - currentWeight;
            maxValue += item.value * ((double)remainingWeight / item.weight);
            break;
        }
    }

    return maxValue;
}
```

```python
def maximize_items(items, weight_limit):
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x.value / x.weight, reverse=True)
    max_value = 0
    current_weight = 0

    for item in items:
        if current_weight + item.weight <= weight_limit:
            max_value += item.value
            current_weight += item.weight
        else:
            remaining_weight = weight_limit - current_weight
            max_value += item.value * (remaining_weight / item.weight)
            break

    return max_value
```
