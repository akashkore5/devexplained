## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain two pointers `start` and `end` to represent the start and end of the window. We will keep expanding the window to the right until the time difference between the activities at `start` and `end` is greater than the given time bounds. When this happens, we will move the `start` pointer to the right until the time difference falls within the bounds again. At each step, we will update the maximum number of activities within the time bounds.

Here is the detailed algorithm:
1. Initialize `start` and `end` pointers to 0, and initialize a variable `maxActivities` to store the maximum number of activities within the time bounds.
2. Iterate through the activities using the `end` pointer:
   - Calculate the time difference between the activities at `start` and `end`.
   - If the time difference is within the bounds, update `maxActivities` if the current number of activities in the window is greater.
   - If the time difference exceeds the bounds, move the `start` pointer to the right until the time difference falls within the bounds.
3. Return the maximum number of activities within the time bounds.

Time complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of activities.

Space complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxUserActivities(int[] activities, int timeBounds) {
        int n = activities.length;
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        int maxActivities = 0;
        
        while (end < n) {
            if (activities[end] - activities[start] <= timeBounds) {
                maxActivities = Math.max(maxActivities, end - start + 1);
                end++;
            } else {
                start++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxActivities;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxUserActivities(vector<int>& activities, int timeBounds) {
        int n = activities.size();
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        int maxActivities = 0;
        
        while (end < n) {
            if (activities[end] - activities[start] <= timeBounds) {
                maxActivities = max(maxActivities, end - start + 1);
                end++;
            } else {
                start++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxActivities;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxUserActivities(self, activities: List[int], timeBounds: int) -> int:
        n = len(activities)
        start = 0
        end = 0
        maxActivities = 0
        
        while end < n:
            if activities[end] - activities[start] <= timeBounds:
                maxActivities = max(maxActivities, end - start + 1)
                end += 1
            else:
                start += 1
        
        return maxActivities
```
