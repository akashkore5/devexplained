## Explanation:

This problem involves guessing a hidden number between 1 and n using bitwise questions. The objective is to minimize the number of questions needed to determine the hidden number.

We can approach this problem by iteratively asking questions about the hidden number's binary representation. By using bitwise operations, we can efficiently infer the bits of the hidden number.

Here's the step-by-step algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. For each bit position from 0 to the maximum number of bits needed to represent numbers up to n:
   - Set a mask with only the current bit position set to 1 (e.g., `1 << i` in binary representation).
   - Ask a question to determine if the hidden number's corresponding bit is set (1) or not (0) by performing a bitwise AND operation with the mask.
   - If the bit is set, update the `result` by setting the bit at the current position to 1.
3. Return the final `result` as the guessed hidden number.

By iteratively querying the binary representation of the hidden number, we can guess the number efficiently.

Time complexity: O(log n) - We make log n queries to determine the hidden number.
Space complexity: O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int mask = 1 << i;
            if ((mask & guess(i)) != 0) {
                result |= mask;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private int guess(int bit) {
        // Implement a function to ask a bitwise question on the bit position 'bit'
        return 0; // Placeholder, actual implementation depends on the problem
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int mask = 1 << i;
            if ((mask & guess(i)) != 0) {
                result |= mask;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    int guess(int bit) {
        // Implement a function to ask a bitwise question on the bit position 'bit'
        return 0; // Placeholder, actual implementation depends on the problem
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(32):
            mask = 1 << i
            if (mask & self.guess(i)) != 0:
                result |= mask
        return result

    def guess(self, bit: int) -> int:
        # Implement a function to ask a bitwise question on the bit position 'bit'
        return 0  # Placeholder, actual implementation depends on the problem
