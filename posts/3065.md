### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Calculate the number of operations needed to make each element in the array greater than or equal to k.
2. Return the sum of all these operations.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `operations` to 0.
2. Iterate over the elements in the array:
   - If the current element is less than k, increment `operations` by the difference between k and the current element.
3. Return the value of `operations`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < k) {
                operations += k - num;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < k) {
                operations += k - num;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        operations = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num < k:
                operations += k - num
        return operations
```
