### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a Depth First Search (DFS) approach on the tree. We can start by considering each edge and its corresponding nodes. For each edge, we can recursively calculate the maximum possible sum of values that Alice can achieve by updating the nodes' values using the XOR operation with `k`. We can keep track of the maximum sum achieved so far and return it as the final result.

#### Steps:
1. Implement a DFS function to traverse the tree and update the nodes' values.
2. For each edge, update the values of the nodes connected by that edge using XOR operation with `k`.
3. Recursively call the DFS function on the new set of nodes.
4. Keep track of the maximum sum achieved so far.
5. Return the maximum sum as the final result.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n) for the recursive stack used in DFS.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[] nums, int k, int[][] edges) {
        // Implement the DFS function here
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<int>& nums, int k, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Implement the DFS function here
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Implement the DFS function here
```
