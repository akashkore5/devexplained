## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each cell of the grid and try all possible values (0, 1, 2) for the cells that belong to the Letter Y. For each possible value assignment, we check if the conditions for the Y letter are satisfied. If they are satisfied, we count the number of operations needed to achieve this configuration and keep track of the minimum number of operations.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `minOperations` to store the minimum number of operations needed.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
3. For each cell, try assigning values 0, 1, and 2 to the cells that belong to the Y configuration.
4. Check if the conditions for the Y letter are satisfied:
   - All values at Y cells are equal.
   - All values at non-Y cells are equal.
   - Values at Y cells are different from non-Y cells.
5. If the conditions are met, calculate the number of operations needed and update `minOperations` if it is lower.
6. Return `minOperations` as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the size of the grid.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

    public int minOperations(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int minOperations = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int val1 = 0; val1 <= 2; val1++) {
            for (int val2 = 0; val2 <= 2; val2++) {
                if (val1 == val2) continue;
                
                int operations = 0;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                        int target = grid[(n - 1) / 2][(n - 1) / 2] == val1 ? val1 : val2;
