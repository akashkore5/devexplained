### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find if there exists a triplet of numbers in the given array such that it forms an increasing subsequence. We can achieve this by iterating through the array and maintaining two variables `first` and `second` to keep track of the minimum and second minimum values seen so far. If we encounter a number greater than `second`, we have found a triplet that satisfies the condition.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize `first` and `second` to positive infinity.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. If the current element is less than `first`, update `first` to the current element.
4. Else if the current element is less than `second`, update `second` to the current element.
5. Else, return true as we have found a triplet.
6. If no triplet is found during the iteration, return false.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        int first = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int second = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num <= first) {
                first = num;
            } else if (num <= second) {
                second = num;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool increasingTriplet(vector<int>& nums) {
        int first = INT_MAX;
        int second = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num <= first) {
                first = num;
            } else if (num <= second) {
                second = num;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = float('inf')
        second = float('inf')
        
        for num in nums:
            if num <= first:
                first = num
            elif num <= second:
                second = num
            else:
                return True
        
        return False
```
