### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can sort both the `apple` array and the `capacity` array in descending order. Then, for each pack of apples, we try to distribute it into the box with the maximum available capacity. If we can't fit a pack into any box, we need to select a new box.

By sorting in descending order, we ensure that we use the boxes with the highest capacity first. This helps in minimizing the number of boxes needed to redistribute the packs of apples.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m), where n is the number of packs of apples and m is the number of boxes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int redistributeApples(int[] apple, int[] capacity) {
        Arrays.sort(apple);
        Arrays.sort(capacity);

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (i < apple.length && j < capacity.length) {
            if (apple[i] <= capacity[j]) {
                i++;
                count++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int redistributeApples(vector<int>& apple, vector<int>& capacity) {
        sort(apple.begin(), apple.end(), greater<int>());
        sort(capacity.begin(), capacity.end(), greater<int>());

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (i < apple.size() && j < capacity.size()) {
            if (apple[i] <= capacity[j]) {
                i++;
                count++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def redistributeApples(self, apple: List[int], capacity: List[int]) -> int:
        apple.sort(reverse=True)
        capacity.sort(reverse=True)

        i, j = 0, 0
        count = 0

        while i < len(apple) and j < len(capacity):
            if apple[i] <= capacity[j]:
                i += 1
                count += 1
            j += 1

        return count
```
