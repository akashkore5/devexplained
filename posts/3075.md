### Explanation:
To maximize the sum of happiness values of selected children, we want to select the children with the highest happiness values in each turn. We can achieve this by sorting the happiness array in descending order and then selecting the k children with the highest happiness values.

### Algorithm:
1. Sort the `happiness` array in descending order.
2. Initialize a variable `totalHappiness` to 0.
3. Iterate through the first k elements of the sorted array and add their values to `totalHappiness`.
4. Return the `totalHappiness`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted array.
:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximizeHappiness(int[] happiness, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(happiness);
        int totalHappiness = 0;
        for (int i = happiness.length - 1; i >= Math.max(0, happiness.length - k); i--) {
            totalHappiness += happiness[i];
        }
        return totalHappiness;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeHappiness(std::vector<int>& happiness, int k) {
        std::sort(happiness.begin(), happiness.end(), std::greater<int>());
        int totalHappiness = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            totalHappiness += happiness[i];
        }
        return totalHappiness;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeHappiness(self, happiness: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        happiness.sort(reverse=True)
        totalHappiness = sum(happiness[:k])
        return totalHappiness
```
