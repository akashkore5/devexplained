## Explanation:

Given a matrix of characters and a pattern, we need to determine if the pattern can be formed by traversing adjacent cells in the matrix. The pattern can contain both letters and numbers, and the traversal can be in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking. We start by iterating through each cell in the matrix and checking if we can form the pattern starting from that cell. We recursively explore all possible paths from that cell by moving to adjacent cells in all directions and matching the characters in the pattern.

### Algorithm:
1. Iterate through each cell in the matrix.
2. For each cell, start the backtracking process to check if the pattern can be formed.
3. In the backtracking function:
   - If the current character in the pattern does not match the character in the current cell, return false.
   - If we have matched all characters in the pattern, return true.
   - Recursively explore all neighboring cells by moving in all directions.
4. Return true if we find a path that matches the pattern starting from the current cell.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(m*n*3^k), where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix and k is the length of the pattern. This is because for each cell, we perform backtracking in three directions for each character in the pattern.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(k) for the recursive call stack, where k is the length of the pattern.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (backtrack(board, word, i, j, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean backtrack(char[][] board, String word, int i, int j, int index) {
        if (index == word.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[0].length || board[i][j] != word.charAt(index)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = ' '; // mark as visited
        
        boolean found = backtrack(board, word, i + 1, j, index + 1) ||
                        backtrack(board, word, i - 1, j, index + 1) ||
                        backtrack(board, word, i, j + 1, index + 1) ||
                        backtrack(board, word, i, j - 1, index + 1);
        
        board[i][j] = temp; // backtrack
        
        return found;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                if (backtrack(board, word, i, j, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool backtrack(vector<vector<char>>& board, string& word, int i, int j, int index) {
        if (index == word.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || board[i][j] != word[index]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = ' '; // mark as visited
        
        bool found = backtrack(board, word, i + 1, j, index + 1) ||
                     backtrack(board, word, i - 1, j, index + 1) ||
                     backtrack(board, word, i, j + 1, index + 1) ||
                     backtrack(board, word, i, j - 1, index + 1);
        
        board[i][j] = temp; // backtrack
        
        return found;
    }
};
```

            return False
        
        temp = board[i][j]
        board[i][j] = ' ' # mark as visited
        
        found = self.backtrack(board, word, i + 1, j, index + 1) or \
                self.backtrack(board, word, i - 1, j, index + 1) or \
                self.backtrack(board, word, i, j + 1, index + 1) or \
