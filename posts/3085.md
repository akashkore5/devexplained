### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and calculate the frequency of each character. Then, we need to determine the minimum number of characters to delete to make the string k-special. We can achieve this by comparing the frequencies of different characters and keeping track of the minimum deletions required.

1. Count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Iterate through the frequencies and check if the absolute difference between any two frequencies is greater than k. If it is, increment the deletions count.
3. Return the total number of deletions needed.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string word.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) since the maximum size of the frequency array is constant (26 lowercase English letters).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletions(String word, int k) {
        int[] freq = new int[26]; // Assuming lowercase English letters
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int deletions = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < freq.length; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                int diff = Math.abs(freq[i] - freq[i - 1]);
                if (diff > k) {
                    deletions += diff - k;
                    freq[i] -= diff - k;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletions(string word, int k) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0); // Assuming lowercase English letters
        for (char c : word) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int deletions = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < freq.size(); i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                int diff = abs(freq[i] - freq[i - 1]);
                if (diff > k) {
                    deletions += diff - k;
                    freq[i] -= diff - k;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 26  # Assuming lowercase English letters
        for c in word:
            freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        deletions = 0
        for i in range(1, len(freq)):
            if freq[i] > 0:
                diff = abs(freq[i] - freq[i - 1])
                if diff > k:
                    deletions += diff - k
                    freq[i] -= diff - k
        
        return deletions
```
