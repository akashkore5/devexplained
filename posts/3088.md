### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest anti-palindrome string that can be formed from the given string. An anti-palindrome string is a string that is not a palindrome. We can achieve this by iterating through the input string and changing characters if needed to make it an anti-palindrome.

1. We iterate from left to right and also from right to left in parallel to check if the characters at the corresponding positions are the same.
2. If a character matches at both ends, we replace one of them with a character that is lexicographically smaller but not equal to the character on the opposite end.
3. If we cannot find such a character, we replace the character at the right end with 'a', as it is the smallest lexicographically.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing the modified string.
```java
class Solution {
    public String makeAntiPalindrome(String s) {
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        int n = chars.length;

        for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
            if (chars[i] == chars[j]) {
                if (chars[i] == 'a') {
                    chars[j] = 'b';
                } else {
                    chars[j] = 'a';
                }
            }
        }

        return String.valueOf(chars);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string makeAntiPalindrome(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                if (s[i] == 'a') {
                    s[j] = 'b';
                } else {
                    s[j] = 'a';
                }
            }
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def makeAntiPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        chars = list(s)
        n = len(chars)

        for i in range(n//2):
            if chars[i] == chars[n-1-i]:
                if chars[i] == 'a':
                    chars[n-1-i] = 'b'
                else:
                    chars[n-1-i] = 'a'

        return ''.join(chars)
```
