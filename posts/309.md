### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with state machines. We can define three states: buy, sell, and cooldown. At each day, we can be in one of these states. We need to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve at each state.

- **sell[i]**: Maximum profit on day `i` if we sell on day `i`.
- **buy[i]**: Maximum profit on day `i` if we buy on day `i`.
- **cooldown[i]**: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are in cooldown on day `i`.

We can update these states based on the following conditions:
- sell[i] = buy[i-1] + prices[i]
- buy[i] = max(cooldown[i-1] - prices[i], buy[i-1])
- cooldown[i] = max(sell[i-1], cooldown[i-1])

The final answer will be the maximum of sell[n-1] and cooldown[n-1], where n is the number of days.

Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int sell = 0, buy = -prices[0], cooldown = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int prevSell = sell;
            sell = buy + prices[i];
            buy = Math.max(cooldown - prices[i], buy);
            cooldown = Math.max(prevSell, cooldown);
        }
        
        return Math.max(sell, cooldown);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int sell = 0, buy = -prices[0], cooldown = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            int prevSell = sell;
            sell = buy + prices[i];
            buy = max(cooldown - prices[i], buy);
            cooldown = max(prevSell, cooldown);
        }
        
        return max(sell, cooldown);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) <= 1:
            return 0
        
        sell = 0
        buy = -prices[0]
        cooldown = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            prev_sell = sell
            sell = buy + prices[i]
            buy = max(cooldown - prices[i], buy)
            cooldown = max(prev_sell, cooldown)
        
        return max(sell, cooldown)
