## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each query word and for each query word, iterate through all the words in the container to find the word with the longest common suffix. We can maintain a variable to keep track of the index of the word with the longest common suffix for each query word.

For each query word:
1. Initialize the index of the word with the longest common suffix as -1 and the length of the longest common suffix as 0.
2. Iterate through all the words in the container.
3. For each word in the container, find the length of the common suffix with the query word.
4. If the length of the common suffix is greater than the current longest common suffix length, update the index of the word with the longest common suffix and the length of the longest common suffix.
5. If the length of the common suffix is equal to the current longest common suffix length, compare the lengths of the words and update the index accordingly.

Finally, return the list of indices of the words with the longest common suffix for each query word.

### Time Complexity
Let n be the total number of characters in all wordsContainer and wordsQuery combined.
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) because we iterate through each query word and for each query word, we iterate through each word in the container to find the longest common suffix.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] longestCommonSuffixQueries(String[] wordsContainer, String[] wordsQuery) {
        int[] ans = new int[wordsQuery.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < wordsQuery.length; i++) {
            int maxIndex = -1;
            int maxLen = 0;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < wordsContainer.length; j++) {
                int len = 0;
                
                while (len < wordsQuery[i].length() && len < wordsContainer[j].length() && 
                       wordsQuery[i].charAt(wordsQuery[i].length() - 1 - len) == wordsContainer[j].charAt(wordsContainer[j].length() - 1 - len)) {
                    len++;
                }
                
                if (len > maxLen || (len == maxLen && wordsContainer[j].length() < wordsContainer[maxIndex].length())) {
                    maxIndex = j;
                    maxLen = len;
                }
            }
            
            ans[i] = maxIndex;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> longestCommonSuffixQueries(vector<string>& wordsContainer, vector<string>& wordsQuery) {
        vector<int> ans;
        
        for (string q : wordsQuery) {
            int maxIndex = -1;
            int maxLen = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < wordsContainer.size(); i++) {
                int len = 0;
                
                while (len < q.length() && len < wordsContainer[i].length() && 
                       q[q.length() - 1 - len] == wordsContainer[i][wordsContainer[i].length() - 1 - len]) {
                    len++;
                }
                
                if (len > maxLen || (len == maxLen && wordsContainer[i].length() < wordsContainer[maxIndex].length())) {
                    maxIndex = i;
                    maxLen = len;
                }
            }
            
            ans.push_back(maxIndex);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
