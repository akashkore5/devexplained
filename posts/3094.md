## Explanation:
This problem involves guessing a hidden number within a given range using bitwise questions. The task is to implement a function `findNumber(int n)` that will return the number to guess. We can use bitwise operations to find the number efficiently.

1. Initialize a variable `result` as 0.
2. Iterate through each bit position from 0 to 30 (since the hidden number is within the range [0, 2^31-1]).
3. For each bit position, we will ask bitwise questions to find the number:
    - For each question, we set the bit at the current position to 1 and all other bits to 0.
    - Check if the answer is greater or equal to the number with the bit set at that position. If true, set the bit at that position in `result` to 1.
4. Return the calculated `result`.

Time Complexity: O(31) = O(1)  
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
public int findNumber(int n) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) {
        int bit = 1 << i;
        int answer = guess(i, bit);
        if (answer >= n) {
            result |= bit;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

```cpp
int findNumber(int n) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 31; i++) {
        int bit = 1 << i;
        int answer = guess(i, bit);
        if (answer >= n) {
            result |= bit;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

```python
def findNumber(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(31):
        bit = 1 << i
        answer = guess(i, bit)
        if answer >= n:
            result |= bit
    return result
```
