## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of levels Alice should play to gain more points than Bob. The key observation here is that Alice and Bob take turns playing levels, and Alice starts first. We can simulate the game by considering all possible combinations of levels played by Alice and Bob. At each step, we calculate the points for Alice and Bob and check if Alice has more points than Bob.

We can optimize the solution by realizing that if Alice plays up to a certain level, Bob will play the remaining levels. We can calculate the total points for Alice and Bob at each step and determine the minimum number of levels Alice needs to play to gain more points.

The algorithmic idea is to iterate through all levels, calculating Alice's points up to that level and Bob's points for the remaining levels. We keep track of the minimum number of levels Alice needs to play to gain more points. If no such number of levels exists, we return -1.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of levels
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minLevelsToGainMorePoints(int[] possible) {
        int n = possible.length;
        int alicePoints = 0;
        int bobPoints = 0;
        int minLevels = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            alicePoints += possible[i];
            bobPoints += possible[i + 1];
            if (alicePoints > bobPoints) {
                minLevels = Math.min(minLevels, i + 1);
            }
        }

        return minLevels == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minLevels;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minLevelsToGainMorePoints(vector<int>& possible) {
        int n = possible.size();
        int alicePoints = 0;
        int bobPoints = 0;
        int minLevels = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            alicePoints += possible[i];
            bobPoints += possible[i + 1];
            if (alicePoints > bobPoints) {
                minLevels = min(minLevels, i + 1);
            }
        }

        return minLevels == INT_MAX ? -1 : minLevels;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minLevelsToGainMorePoints(self, possible: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(possible)
        alice_points = 0
        bob_points = 0
        min_levels = float('inf')

        for i in range(n - 1):
            alice_points += possible[i]
            bob_points += possible[i + 1]
            if alice_points > bob_points:
                min_levels = min(min_levels, i + 1)

        return -1 if min_levels == float('inf') else min_levels
