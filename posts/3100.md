### Explanation:
- The problem is asking to find the maximum number of water bottles that can be drunk given the initial number of full water bottles and the exchange rate.
- We can simulate the process by keeping track of the number of full bottles, empty bottles, and the exchange rate.
- We continuously exchange empty bottles for full bottles until we do not have enough empty bottles to exchange.
- The process stops when the number of empty bottles is fewer than the exchange rate.
- The maximum number of water bottles that can be drunk is the sum of the initial full bottles and the number of full bottles obtained from exchanging empty bottles.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int total = numBottles;
        int empty = numBottles;
        
        while (empty >= numExchange) {
            int newBottles = empty / numExchange;
            total += newBottles;
            empty = newBottles + empty % numExchange;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int total = numBottles;
        int empty = numBottles;
        
        while (empty >= numExchange) {
            int newBottles = empty / numExchange;
            total += newBottles;
            empty = newBottles + empty % numExchange;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        total = numBottles
        empty = numBottles
        
        while empty >= numExchange:
            new_bottles = empty // numExchange
            total += new_bottles
            empty = new_bottles + empty % numExchange
        
        return total
```
