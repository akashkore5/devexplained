### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and count the number of alternating subarrays at each index. We can use a sliding window approach to keep track of the current alternating subarray, and update the count accordingly. The key idea is to consider the current element and the previous element to determine if they form an alternating subarray.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the total number of alternating subarrays.
2. Initialize a variable `prev` to store the value of the previous element.
3. Initialize a variable `currentLength` to keep track of the length of the current alternating subarray.
4. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current element is different from the previous element, increment `currentLength` by 1.
   - Otherwise, update the `count` by adding the number of subarrays that can be formed with the current alternating subarray length, and reset `currentLength`.
   - Update `prev` to the current element.
5. After the loop ends, add the remaining subarrays that end at the last index to the `count`.
6. Return the total `count`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countAlternatingSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int prev = -1;
        int currentLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num != prev) {
                currentLength++;
            } else {
                count += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2;
                currentLength = 1;
            }
            prev = num;
        }
        
        count += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2;
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countAlternatingSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int prev = -1;
        int currentLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num != prev) {
                currentLength++;
            } else {
                count += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2;
                currentLength = 1;
            }
            prev = num;
        }
        
        count += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2;
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countAlternatingSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        prev = -1
        currentLength = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num != prev:
                currentLength += 1
            else:
                count += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) // 2
                currentLength = 1
            prev = num
        
        count += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) // 2
        
        return count
