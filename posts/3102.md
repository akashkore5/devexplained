### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible value for the maximum distance between any two points by removing exactly one point. We can achieve this by iterating through each point, removing it, and calculating the maximum distance between the remaining points. The minimum of these maximum distances will be our answer.

1. Create a helper function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points.
2. Iterate through each point and remove it from the array.
3. For each iteration, calculate the maximum distance between the remaining points.
4. Keep track of the minimum maximum distance found.
5. Return the minimum maximum distance.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of points.
Space Complexity: O(1) constant space is used.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMaxDistances(int[][] points) {
        int minMaxDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            int maxDistance = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for (int j = 0; j < points.length; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, Math.abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0]) + Math.abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1]));
                }
            }
            minMaxDistance = Math.min(minMaxDistance, maxDistance);
        }
        
        return minMaxDistance;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMaxDistances(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int minMaxDistance = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int maxDistance = INT_MIN;
            for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    maxDistance = max(maxDistance, abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0]) + abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1]));
                }
            }
            minMaxDistance = min(minMaxDistance, maxDistance);
        }
        
        return minMaxDistance;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minMaxDistances(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        min_max_distance = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(len(points)):
            max_distance = float('-inf')
            for j in range(len(points)):
                if i != j:
                    max_distance = max(max_distance, abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0]) + abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1]))
            min_max_distance = min(min_max_distance, max_distance)
        
        return min_max_distance
