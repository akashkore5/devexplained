## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate over the characters in the input string `s` and for each character, we can find the closest character that minimizes the distance based on the cyclic order of lowercase English letters. We can use this information to construct the lexicographically smallest string that satisfies the given distance constraint `k`. We can achieve this by replacing characters in `s` with the closest characters that reduce the distance to `k`.

### Algorithm:
1. For each character in the input string `s`, find the closest character that minimizes the distance in the cyclic order of lowercase English letters.
2. Replace each character with the closest character to minimize the overall distance to `k`.
3. Return the modified string as the lexicographically smallest string with distance less than or equal to `k`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the modified string.
```java
class Solution {
    public String findLexSmallestString(String s, int k) {
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            int diff1 = chars[i] - 'a';
            int diff2 = 'z' - chars[i];
            int minDiff = Math.min(diff1, diff2);
            if (minDiff <= k) {
                chars[i] = (char) ('a' + (k >= diff1 ? diff1 : -diff2));
                k -= minDiff;
            }
        }
        return new String(chars);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLexSmallestString(string s, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            int diff1 = s[i] - 'a';
            int diff2 = 'z' - s[i];
            int minDiff = min(diff1, diff2);
            if (minDiff <= k) {
                s[i] = 'a' + (k >= diff1 ? diff1 : -diff2);
                k -= minDiff;
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findLexSmallestString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        chars = list(s)
        for i in range(len(chars)):
            diff1 = ord(chars[i]) - ord('a')
            diff2 = ord('z') - ord(chars[i])
            min_diff = min(diff1, diff2)
            if min_diff <= k:
                chars[i] = chr(ord('a') + (diff1 if k >= diff1 else -diff2))
                k -= min_diff
        return ''.join(chars)
