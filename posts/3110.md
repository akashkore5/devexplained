### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters in the given string and sum them up to get the final score. We can iterate through the characters of the string and calculate the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters. Finally, we sum up all the absolute differences to get the score.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int scoreOfAString(String s) {
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            score += Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1));
        }
        return score;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfAString(std::string s) {
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            score += std::abs(s[i] - s[i - 1]);
        }
        return score;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def scoreOfAString(self, s: str) -> int:
        score = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            score += abs(ord(s[i]) - ord(s[i - 1]))
        return score
```
