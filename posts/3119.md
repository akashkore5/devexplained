### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate through the given array to find consecutive pairs of potholes that can be fixed together. We fix as many potholes as possible by choosing the maximum number of pairs. To do this, we check if the current pothole and the next pothole can be fixed together without exceeding the limit of fixed potholes. If they can be fixed together, we increase the count of fixed potholes by 2 and move to the next pair of potholes. If they cannot be fixed together, we move to the next pothole.

By iterating through the array and applying this greedy approach, we can maximize the number of potholes that can be fixed.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of potholes in the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPotholes(int[] nums, int limit) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] <= limit) {
                count += 2;
                i++; // Move to the next pair of potholes
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPotholes(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] <= limit) {
                count += 2;
                i++; // Move to the next pair of potholes
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPotholes(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums) - 1:
            if nums[i] + nums[i + 1] <= limit:
                count += 2
                i += 2 # Move to the next pair of potholes
            else:
                i += 1
        return count
```
