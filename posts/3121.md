### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and keep track of the lowercase and uppercase characters we have encountered so far. We can use a set to store the lowercase characters and another set to store the uppercase characters. Whenever we encounter a character that is special according to the given condition, we increment our count of special characters.

- We iterate through the input string.
- For each character:
  - If it is lowercase, we add it to the set of lowercase characters.
  - If it is uppercase, we check if its corresponding lowercase character is in the set of lowercase characters. If so, we increment the count of special characters and remove the lowercase character from the set.
- Finally, we return the count of special characters.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) since the sets used to store lowercase and uppercase characters will have a constant number of elements (26 characters).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSpecialCharacters(String word) {
        Set<Character> lower = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Character> upper = new HashSet<>();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
                lower.add(c);
            } else {
                if (lower.contains(Character.toLowerCase(c))) {
                    count++;
                    lower.remove(Character.toLowerCase(c));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSpecialCharacters(string word) {
        unordered_set<char> lower;
        unordered_set<char> upper;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char c : word) {
            if (islower(c)) {
                lower.insert(c);
            } else {
                if (lower.count(tolower(c))) {
                    count++;
                    lower.erase(tolower(c));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countSpecialCharacters(self, word: str) -> int:
        lower = set()
        upper = set()
        count = 0
        
        for c in word:
            if c.islower():
                lower.add(c)
            else:
                if c.lower() in lower:
                    count += 1
                    lower.remove(c.lower())
        
        return count
```
