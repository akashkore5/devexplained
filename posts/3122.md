### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the matrix row by row and perform the necessary operations to satisfy the given conditions. We need to ensure that each cell is equal to the cell below it and different from the cell to its right.

We can keep track of the number of operations needed to satisfy these conditions at each cell. At each cell, we can adjust the value to match the cell below it and then update the value to be different from the cell to its right if needed.

After iterating through the entire matrix, we can sum up the total number of operations needed to satisfy the conditions.

- Time complexity: O(m * n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] >= grid[i + 1][j]) {
                    operations += grid[i][j] - grid[i + 1][j] + 1;
                    grid[i + 1][j] = grid[i][j] + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] >= grid[i + 1][j]) {
                    operations += grid[i][j] - grid[i + 1][j] + 1;
                    grid[i + 1][j] = grid[i][j] + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        operations = 0
        
        for i in range(m - 1):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] >= grid[i + 1][j]:
                    operations += grid[i][j] - grid[i + 1][j] + 1
                    grid[i + 1][j] = grid[i][j] + 1
        
        return operations
```
