## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach. We will iterate through the given array of calls and maintain two arrays to store the maximum profit we can get if we choose to make or skip a call at each position. At each step, we update these arrays based on the previous values.

Here are the steps for our algorithm:
1. Initialize two arrays, `dpMake` and `dpSkip`, both of size n (the number of calls).
2. Set `dpMake[0]` as the profit of the first call and `dpSkip[0]` as 0 (since we skip the first call).
3. Iterate from index 1 to n-1:
   - Update `dpMake[i]` as the maximum profit between the profit of the current call plus `dpSkip[i-1]` and the profit of the previous call.
   - Update `dpSkip[i]` as the maximum profit between the previous call's profit and `dpSkip[i-1]`.
4. Return the maximum between the last element of `dpMake` and `dpSkip`.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLongestCalls(int[] calls) {
        int n = calls.length;
        int[] dpMake = new int[n];
        int[] dpSkip = new int[n];
        
        dpMake[0] = calls[0];
        dpSkip[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dpMake[i] = Math.max(calls[i] + dpSkip[i-1], dpMake[i-1]);
            dpSkip[i] = Math.max(dpMake[i-1], dpSkip[i-1]);
        }
        
        return Math.max(dpMake[n-1], dpSkip[n-1]);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLongestCalls(vector<int>& calls) {
        int n = calls.size();
        vector<int> dpMake(n);
        vector<int> dpSkip(n);
        
        dpMake[0] = calls[0];
        dpSkip[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dpMake[i] = max(calls[i] + dpSkip[i-1], dpMake[i-1]);
            dpSkip[i] = max(dpMake[i-1], dpSkip[i-1]);
        }
        
        return max(dpMake[n-1], dpSkip[n-1]);
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def findLongestCalls(self, calls: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(calls)
        dp_make = [0] * n
        dp_skip = [0] * n
        
        dp_make[0] = calls[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp_make[i] = max(calls[i] + dp_skip[i-1], dp_make[i-1])
            dp_skip[i] = max(dp_make[i-1], dp_skip[i-1])
        
        return max(dp_make[n-1], dp_skip[n-1])
```
