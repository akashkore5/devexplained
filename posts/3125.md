### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number that can be obtained such that the result of bitwise AND of all numbers from 1 to that maximum number is zero.

1. We need to find the maximum number "x" such that the bitwise AND of all numbers from 1 to x is zero.
2. We can observe that if we have a number "y" where all the bits are set to 1 up to a certain position, then the bitwise AND of all numbers from 1 to y will have all bits set to 0 from that position onwards.
3. Therefore, we can start from the most significant bit and iterate through each bit position. If setting the bit to 1 in the current position does not exceed the target number "n", we can set that bit to 1. Otherwise, we keep it as 0.
4. By following the above approach, we can find the maximum number that satisfies the condition.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximumXOR(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        int bit = 1 << 30;
        while ((n & bit) == 0) {
            bit >>= 1;
        }
        while (bit > 0) {
            result |= bit;
            bit >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximumXOR(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        int bit = 1 << 30;
        while ((n & bit) == 0) {
            bit >>= 1;
        }
        while (bit > 0) {
            result |= bit;
            bit >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaximumXOR(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        bit = 1 << 30
        while (n & bit) == 0:
            bit >>= 1
        while bit > 0:
            result |= bit
            bit >>= 1
        return result
```
