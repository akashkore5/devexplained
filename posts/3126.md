### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the server utilization time based on the input requests. We iterate through the requests and maintain a running sum of the server load. If the load exceeds the given threshold, we increment the server utilization time.

1. Initialize variables `totalTime` and `currentLoad` to 0.
2. Iterate through the list of requests:
   - Add the request time to `currentLoad`.
   - If `currentLoad` exceeds the threshold:
     - Increment `totalTime` by 1.
     - Reset `currentLoad` to the current request time.
3. Return `totalTime`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of requests.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra memory.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int serverUtilizationTime(int[] requests, int threshold) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        int currentLoad = 0;

        for (int request : requests) {
            currentLoad += request;
            if (currentLoad > threshold) {
                totalTime++;
                currentLoad = request;
            }
        }

        return totalTime;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int serverUtilizationTime(vector<int>& requests, int threshold) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        int currentLoad = 0;

        for (int request : requests) {
            currentLoad += request;
            if (currentLoad > threshold) {
                totalTime++;
                currentLoad = request;
            }
        }

        return totalTime;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def serverUtilizationTime(self, requests: List[int], threshold: int) -> int:
        totalTime = 0
        currentLoad = 0

        for request in requests:
            currentLoad += request
            if currentLoad > threshold:
                totalTime += 1
                currentLoad = request

        return totalTime
```
