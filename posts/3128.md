### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each cell in the grid and treat it as the top vertex of a potential right triangle. We then check for other vertices in the same row and column to form a right triangle with the current vertex. If such vertices exist, we increment the count of right triangles.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to store the count of right triangles.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
3. For each cell, check all other cells in the same row and column to find potential vertices for a right triangle with the current cell.
4. If a right triangle can be formed with the current cell as the top vertex, increment the `count`.
5. Return the final count of right triangles.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countRightTriangles(int[][] grid) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    for (int k = 0; k < grid.length; k++) {
                        if (grid[k][j] == 1 && i != k) {
                            for (int l = 0; l < grid[0].length; l++) {
                                if (grid[i][l] == 1 && j != l) {
                                    count++;
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countRightTriangles(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    for (int k = 0; k < grid.size(); k++) {
                        if (grid[k][j] == 1 && i != k) {
                            for (int l = 0; l < grid[0].size(); l++) {
                                if (grid[i][l] == 1 && j != l) {
                                    count++;
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
