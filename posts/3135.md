## Explanation:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, we need to equalize them by adding or removing characters at the ends. We can perform the following operations:
- Add a character to the start of a string
- Add a character to the end of a string
- Remove a character from the start of a string
- Remove a character from the end of a string

To equalize the strings, we can start from both ends of the strings and compare the characters. If the characters are equal, we move towards the center. If the characters are not equal, we have two options:
1. Add the character from one string to the other string at the corresponding end.
2. Remove the character from one string.

We repeat this process until the strings are equal in length and content.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` at the start and end of both strings.
2. While `i < j` in both strings:
   - If `s[i] == t[j]`, increment `i` and decrement `j`.
   - If `s[i] != t[j]`, we have two choices:
     - Increment `i` in `s` and leave `j` in `t` the same.
     - Increment `j` in `t` and leave `i` in `s` the same.
3. After the loop, the strings should be equal in length and content.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string between `s` and `t`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input.

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] equalizeStrings(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (s.length() < t.length()) {
                s = "a" + s;
                i++;
            } else {
                t = "a" + t;
                j++;
            }
        }
        while (i < s.length()) {
            s = "a" + s;
            i++;
        }
        while (j < t.length()) {
            t = "a" + t;
            j++;
        }
        return new String[]{s, t};
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> equalizeStrings(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (s.length() < t.length()) {
                s = "a" + s;
                i++;
            } else {
                t = "a" + t;
                j++;
            }
        }
        while (i < s.length()) {
            s = "a" + s;
            i++;
        }
        while (j < t.length()) {
            t = "a" + t;
            j++;
        }
        return {s, t};
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def equalizeStrings(self, s: str, t: str) -> List[str]:
        i, j = 0, 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif len(s) < len(t):
                s = 'a' + s
                i += 1
            else:
                t = 'a' + t
                j += 1
        while i < len(s):
            s = 'a' + s
            i += 1
        while j < len(t):
            t = 'a' + t
            j += 1
        return [s, t]
