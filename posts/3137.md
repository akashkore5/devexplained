### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible choices of `i` and `j` such that they are divisible by `k`. For each pair of `i` and `j`, we can calculate the number of operations required to make the word `k-periodic` by replacing the substring at index `i` with the substring at index `j`.

We can achieve this by checking the characters at indices `i` and `j` for equality and counting how many characters need to be replaced. The minimum number of operations will be the minimum count obtained over all pairs of `i` and `j`.

### Algorithm:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs of `i` and `j` such that `i` and `j` are divisible by `k`.
2. For each pair, calculate the count of characters that need to be replaced.
3. Keep track of the minimum count obtained.
4. Return the minimum count as the answer.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input word.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space apart from some constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minChanges(String word, int k) {
        int n = word.length();
        int minChanges = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int changes = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += k) {
                if (word.charAt(j) != word.charAt(i)) {
                    changes++;
                }
            }
            minChanges = Math.min(minChanges, changes);
        }
        
        return minChanges;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minChanges(std::string word, int k) {
        int n = word.length();
        int minChanges = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int changes = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += k) {
                if (word[j] != word[i]) {
                    changes++;
                }
            }
            minChanges = std::min(minChanges, changes);
        }
        
        return minChanges;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        min_changes = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(k):
            changes = 0
            for j in range(i, n, k):
                if word[j] != word[i]:
                    changes += 1
            min_changes = min(min_changes, changes)
        
        return min_changes
