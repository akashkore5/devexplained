### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum cost required to make all elements in the array equal. We can achieve this by considering two scenarios for each element in the array:
1. Increasing the value at a single index by `cost1`.
2. Increasing the values at two different indices by `cost2`.

We will iterate through the array and calculate the cost for each of the two scenarios. At each step, we will choose the minimum cost among the two scenarios. Finally, we return the total minimum cost modulo 10^9 + 7.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] nums, int cost1, int cost2) {
        long totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            totalCost += Math.min(cost1 * (long)(nums[i + 1] - nums[i]), cost2);
        }
        return (int)(totalCost % 1000000007);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& nums, int cost1, int cost2) {
        long totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            totalCost += min((long)cost1 * (nums[i + 1] - nums[i]), (long)cost2);
        }
        return totalCost % 1000000007;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], cost1: int, cost2: int) -> int:
        total_cost = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            total_cost += min(cost1 * (nums[i + 1] - nums[i]), cost2)
        return total_cost % 1000000007
```
