### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate over each pair of integers in the given array and calculate the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given that the integers are in the range 0 to 10^9, we can compare each bit of the integers by converting them to their binary representation. We then count the number of differing bits to get the Hamming distance.

To find the maximum total Hamming distance, we need to maximize the number of differing bits across all pairs of integers. One way to do this is to iterate over each bit position from right to left and count the number of 0s and 1s at that position. The Hamming distance at that bit position will be the product of the count of 0s and 1s. By summing these products across all bit positions, we can obtain the maximum total Hamming distance.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int maxHammingDistance = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int xor = nums[i] ^ nums[j];
                int hammingDistance = Integer.bitCount(xor);
                maxHammingDistance = Math.max(maxHammingDistance, hammingDistance);
            }
        }
        
        return maxHammingDistance;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxHammingDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int maxHammingDistance = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int xorVal = nums[i] ^ nums[j];
                int hammingDistance = __builtin_popcount(xorVal);
                maxHammingDistance = max(maxHammingDistance, hammingDistance);
            }
        }
        
        return maxHammingDistance;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxHammingDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        maxHammingDistance = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                xor_val = nums[i] ^ nums[j]
                hamming_distance = bin(xor_val).count('1')
                maxHammingDistance = max(maxHammingDistance, hamming_distance)
        
        return maxHammingDistance
```
