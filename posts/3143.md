### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all pairs of points and calculate the distance between them. For each pair of points, we can consider the point that lies exactly in the middle of the two points. This point can be the center of a square if the distances to both points are the same and the square is not intersecting with any other points of the same tag.

1. Iterate through all pairs of points.
2. Calculate the distance between the points and find the middle point.
3. Check if a square can be formed with the middle point as the center.
4. Count the number of points that can be contained inside the square.
5. Keep track of the maximum number of points in a valid square.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of points.
Space Complexity: O(1)

    public int countPoints(int[][] points, String s) {
        int maxPoints = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
                int x1 = points[i][0];
                int y1 = points[i][1];

                int y2 = points[j][1];
                
                int midX = (x1 + x2) / 2;
