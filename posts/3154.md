## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each stair up to `k`. We can define a dp array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach stair `i`.

At each step, we can either go down to `i-1` or go up to `i+2*jump`. We need to consider both cases and update the `dp` array accordingly.

The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, as we can reach stair 0 from stair 1 in one way, and we are already at stair 1 initially.

The time complexity of this approach is O(k) as we iterate through all stairs up to `k`, and the space complexity is also O(k) to store the dp array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numWays(int k) {
        int[] dp = new int[k + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[k];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int k) {
        vector<int> dp(k + 1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[k];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, k: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (k + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, k + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
        
        return dp[k]
```
