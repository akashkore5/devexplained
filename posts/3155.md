## Explanation:

Given a list of integers representing the processing power of servers and a list of integers representing the target upgrade for each server, we need to find the maximum number of servers that can be upgraded.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort both the servers array and the target array in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of servers that can be upgraded.
3. Iterate over the sorted server array and for each server, find the maximum target that can be upgraded by checking with the target array.
4. If the target can be upgraded, increment the count and remove the target from the target array.
5. Return the count as the result.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of servers.
Space complexity: O(n) for sorting.

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxServers(int[] servers, int[] target) {
        Arrays.sort(servers);
        Arrays.sort(target);
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int server : servers) {
            for (int i = 0; i < target.length; i++) {
                if (server >= target[i]) {
                    count++;
                    target = Arrays.copyOfRange(target, i + 1, target.length);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxServers(vector<int>& servers, vector<int>& target) {
        sort(servers.begin(), servers.end());
        sort(target.begin(), target.end());
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int server : servers) {
            for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
                if (server >= target[i]) {
                    count++;
                    target.erase(target.begin() + i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxServers(self, servers: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        servers.sort()
        target.sort()
        
        count = 0
        for server in servers:
            for i in range(len(target)):
                if server >= target[i]:
                    count += 1
                    del target[i]
                    break
        
        return count
```
