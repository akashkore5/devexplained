### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate through each query, update the nums array based on the query, and then calculate the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements using dynamic programming. We will keep track of two variables, `inclusive` and `exclusive`, where `inclusive` represents the maximum sum including the current element, and `exclusive` represents the maximum sum excluding the current element. At each step, we update these variables based on the previous values. Finally, we return the sum of the maximum sums for all queries modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of elements in the nums array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int inclusive = 0, exclusive = 0;
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int pos = query[0];
            int val = query[1];
            nums[pos] = val;
            int newInclusive = Math.max(inclusive, exclusive + nums[pos]);
            exclusive = inclusive;
            inclusive = newInclusive;
        }
        return inclusive % mod;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int inclusive = 0, exclusive = 0;
        for (auto query : queries) {
            int pos = query[0];
            int val = query[1];
            nums[pos] = val;
            int newInclusive = max(inclusive, exclusive + nums[pos]);
            exclusive = inclusive;
            inclusive = newInclusive;
        }
        return inclusive % mod;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        mod = 1000000007
        inclusive = 0
        exclusive = 0
        for query in queries:
            pos = query[0]
            val = query[1]
            nums[pos] = val
            newInclusive = max(inclusive, exclusive + nums[pos])
            exclusive = inclusive
            inclusive = newInclusive
        return inclusive % mod
```
