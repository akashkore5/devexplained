### Explanation:
- We can simulate the events in the waiting room by maintaining a count of people currently in the room.
- Whenever a person enters, we increment the count, and when a person leaves, we decrement the count.
- The minimum number of chairs needed is the maximum count of people in the room at any given time.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minChairs(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;
        
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if(c == 'E') {
                count++;
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minChairs(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;
        
        for(char c : s) {
            if(c == 'E') {
                count++;
                maxCount = max(maxCount, count);
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minChairs(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        max_count = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if c == 'E':
                count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count, count)
            else:
                count -= 1
        
        return max_count
```
