### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the meetings and mark the days when meetings are scheduled. Then, we can iterate through the total number of days and count the days when no meetings are scheduled.

1. Create a boolean array `schedule` of size `days` initialized with `false`.
2. Iterate through the `meetings` array and mark the days when meetings are scheduled in the `schedule` array.
3. Iterate through the total number of days and count the days when no meetings are scheduled.
4. Return the count of days without meetings.

**Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the total number of days.

**Space Complexity:** O(N) for the boolean array `schedule`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countDaysWithoutMeetings(int days, int[][] meetings) {
        boolean[] schedule = new boolean[days + 1];
        for (int[] meeting : meetings) {
            for (int day = meeting[0]; day <= meeting[1]; day++) {
                schedule[day] = true;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int day = 1; day <= days; day++) {
            if (!schedule[day]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDaysWithoutMeetings(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        vector<bool> schedule(days + 1, false);
        for (auto meeting : meetings) {
            for (int day = meeting[0]; day <= meeting[1]; day++) {
                schedule[day] = true;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int day = 1; day <= days; day++) {
            if (!schedule[day]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countDaysWithoutMeetings(self, days: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        schedule = [False] * (days + 1)
        for meeting in meetings:
            for day in range(meeting[0], meeting[1] + 1):
                schedule[day] = True
        
        count = 0
        for day in range(1, days + 1):
            if not schedule[day]:
                count += 1
        
        return count
```
