## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible subarrays and calculate the bitwise OR value for each subarray. Then, we compare the absolute difference between the calculated OR value and the target value k to find the minimum absolute difference.

Here is the algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `minDiff` to store the minimum absolute difference.
2. Iterate through all subarrays using two nested loops for start index `i` and end index `j`.
3. Calculate the bitwise OR value of the subarray elements between index `i` and `j`.
4. Update `minDiff` if the absolute difference between the calculated OR value and k is smaller than the current `minDiff`.
5. Return the final `minDiff` as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is the number of elements in the input array nums.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int closestToTarget(int[] nums, int k) {
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int current = nums[i];
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(current - k));
            
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                current |= nums[j];
                minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(current - k));
                
                if (current == k) {
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int closestToTarget(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int current = nums[i];
            minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(current - k));
            
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                current |= nums[j];
                minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(current - k));
                
                if (current == k) {
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def closestToTarget(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        minDiff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            current = nums[i]
            minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(current - k))
            
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                current |= nums[j]
                minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(current - k))
                
                if current == k:
                    return 0
                    
        return minDiff
