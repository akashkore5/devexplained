## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach by iterating through the given list of integers and checking if the current number is greater than its previous number. If it is, we increment a counter. The counter keeps track of the number of days where the stock price increased compared to the previous day. Finally, we return the counter value as the result.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Iterate through the list of stock prices.
3. For each stock price, check if it is greater than the previous stock price.
4. If it is, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter value as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the given list of stock prices.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:
:
```java
public int secondDayVerification(int[] prices) {
    int days = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            days++;
        }
    }
    return days;
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
int secondDayVerification(vector<int>& prices) {
    int days = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            days++;
        }
    }
    return days;
}
```

### Python:
```python
def secondDayVerification(prices):
    days = 0
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
            days += 1
    return days
```
