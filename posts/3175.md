## Explanation
To find the first player to win k games in a row, we can simulate the competition process by using a queue to keep track of the players. We will iterate through the players, playing games until we find a player who wins k games in a row. We will track the current winning streak and reset it whenever a player loses. Once we find a player who wins k games in a row, we return their initial index.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a queue to store the indices of the players.
2. Initialize variables for current winning streak and the player who won k games in a row.
3. Iterate through the players:
   - Compare the skill levels of the first two players in the queue.
   - If the player with higher skill level wins, move them to the front of the queue and increment the winning streak.
   - If the winning streak equals k, return the initial index of the winning player.
   - Otherwise, move the losing player to the end of the queue and reset the winning streak.
4. If no player wins k games in a row, return -1.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of players.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) to store the queue of players.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int[] skills, int k) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < skills.length; i++) {
            queue.offer(i);
        }
        
        int winningStreak = 0;
        int winner = -1;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int player1 = queue.poll();
            int player2 = queue.poll();
            
            if (skills[player1] > skills[player2]) {
                queue.offer(player1);
                winningStreak++;
            } else {
                queue.offer(player2);
                winningStreak = 1;
            }

                break;
