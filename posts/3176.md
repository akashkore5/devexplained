### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach where we iterate through the input array `nums` and construct the subsequence by selecting the maximum element at each step while ensuring that the conditions are met. We can keep track of the count of consecutive different elements encountered so far and use this information to limit the selection of elements in the subsequence.

### Algorithm
1. Sort the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the count of consecutive different elements encountered.
3. Iterate through the sorted array and greedily select each element to form the subsequence, ensuring that the count of consecutive different elements does not exceed `k`.
4. Return the length of the subsequence.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) for storing the sorted array.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxGoodSubsequence(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || nums[i] != nums[i - 1] || count < k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxGoodSubsequence(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i == 0 || nums[i] != nums[i - 1] || count < k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxGoodSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i == 0 or nums[i] != nums[i - 1] or count < k:
                count += 1
        return count
```
