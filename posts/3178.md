## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the passing of the ball among the children. We need to keep track of which child currently has the ball and the direction in which it is being passed. We iterate through seconds passing the ball to the next child and updating the direction if the ball reaches either end of the line.

1. Initialize variables `ballHolder` to 0 (representing child 0 holding the ball), `direction` to 1 (representing passing towards the right), and `remainingSec` to k.
2. While `remainingSec` is greater than 0:
   - If `direction` is 1 and `ballHolder` is n-1, update `direction` to -1 (passing towards the left).
   - If `direction` is -1 and `ballHolder` is 0, update `direction` to 1 (passing towards the right).
   - Update `ballHolder` to the next child based on the current direction.
   - Decrement `remainingSec` by 1.
3. Return the final `ballHolder`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(k) as we iterate through k seconds, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheBall(int n, int k) {
        int ballHolder = 0;
        int direction = 1;
        int remainingSec = k;

        while (remainingSec > 0) {
            if (direction == 1 && ballHolder == n - 1) {
                direction = -1;
            } else if (direction == -1 && ballHolder == 0) {
                direction = 1;
            }
            ballHolder += direction;
            remainingSec--;
        }

        return ballHolder;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheBall(int n, int k) {
        int ballHolder = 0;
        int direction = 1;
        int remainingSec = k;

        while (remainingSec > 0) {
            if (direction == 1 && ballHolder == n - 1) {
                direction = -1;
            } else if (direction == -1 && ballHolder == 0) {
                direction = 1;
            }
            ballHolder += direction;
            remainingSec--;
        }

        return ballHolder;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheBall(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        ballHolder = 0
        direction = 1
        remainingSec = k

        while remainingSec > 0:
            if direction == 1 and ballHolder == n - 1:
                direction = -1
            elif direction == -1 and ballHolder == 0:
                direction = 1
            ballHolder += direction
            remainingSec -= 1

        return ballHolder
```
