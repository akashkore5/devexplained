### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use bit manipulation to represent the presence of letters in a word. We can convert each word into a 26-bit integer where each bit represents the presence of a letter from 'a' to 'z'. By doing this conversion for all words, we can compare each pair of words to check if they have any common letters.

1. Convert each word into a 26-bit integer representation.
2. Compare each pair of words to check if they have any common letters using bitwise AND operation.
3. Calculate the product of the lengths of words that do not share common letters.
4. Keep track of the maximum product found.

Time Complexity: O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of a word.
Space Complexity: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        int[] wordBits = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (char c : words[i].toCharArray()) {
                wordBits[i] |= 1 << (c - 'a');
            }
        }
        
        int maxProduct = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if ((wordBits[i] & wordBits[j]) == 0) {
                    maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, words[i].length() * words[j].length());
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        vector<int> wordBits(n, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (char c : words[i]) {
                wordBits[i] |= 1 << (c - 'a');
            }
        }
        
        int maxProduct = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if ((wordBits[i] & wordBits[j]) == 0) {
                    maxProduct = max(maxProduct, (int)(words[i].length() * words[j].length()));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(words)
        word_bits = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            for c in words[i]:
                word_bits[i] |= 1 << (ord(c) - ord('a'))
        
        max_product = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (word_bits[i] & word_bits[j]) == 0:
                    max_product = max(max_product, len(words[i]) * len(words[j]))
        
        return max_product
