## Explanation:

To find the top scoring students II, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the top `k` students based on their scores. We will iterate through the students' scores and add them to the priority queue. If the size of the priority queue exceeds `k`, we will remove the lowest scoring student from the queue. At the end, we will have the top `k` scoring students in the priority queue.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n log k), where n is the number of students and k is the number of top scoring students we want to find.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this approach is O(k) to store the top scoring students in the priority queue.

:
:
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int[] findTopScoringStudents(int[] scores, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        
        for (int score : scores) {
            pq.offer(score);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        
        int[] topScores = new int[k];
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            topScores[i] = pq.poll();
        }
        
        return topScores;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findTopScoringStudents(vector<int>& scores, int k) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        
        for (int score : scores) {
            pq.push(score);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> topScores(k);
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            topScores[i] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return topScores;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findTopScoringStudents(self, scores: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        pq = []
        
        for score in scores:
            heapq.heappush(pq, score)
            if len(pq) > k:
                heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        top_scores = []
        for _ in range(k):
            top_scores.append(heapq.heappop(pq))
        
        return top_scores
```
