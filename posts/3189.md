## Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of moves required to make a board peaceful. A board is peaceful if every cell is either empty or contains a piece with the same color as its adjacent pieces.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate through the board and check each cell. If a cell violates the peaceful condition, we calculate the number of moves required to make it peaceful by changing the color of the piece in that cell.

We can change the color of a piece in a cell to the opposite color by counting the number of same-colored pieces on the same row and same column. To minimize the moves, we choose the color that requires the minimum number of changes.

By repeating this process for all cells, we can find the total minimum number of moves required to make the board peaceful.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `moves` to 0 to keep track of the total moves.
2. Iterate through each cell of the board.
3. For each cell, count the number of same-colored pieces in the same row and same column.
4. Calculate the minimum moves required to change the color of the piece in that cell to make it peaceful.
5. Add the minimum moves to the total moves.
6. Return the total moves as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of rows or columns in the board.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input.
