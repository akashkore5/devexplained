## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible triplets of elements in the given array and count the number of triplets where the XOR of the elements is even. We can achieve this by using three nested loops to generate all possible triplets and then checking if the XOR of the elements in the triplet is even.

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to store the count of triplets with even XOR.
2. Use three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets in the array.
3. For each triplet, calculate the XOR of the elements.
4. If the XOR is even, increment the count.
5. Finally, return the count as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriplets(int[] arr) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = arr.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                    if ((arr[i] ^ arr[j] ^ arr[k]) % 2 == 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countTriplets(vector<int>& arr) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = arr.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                    if ((arr[i] ^ arr[j] ^ arr[k]) % 2 == 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        n = len(arr)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if (arr[i] ^ arr[j] ^ arr[k]) % 2 == 0:
                        count += 1
        
        return count
```
