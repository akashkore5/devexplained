## Explanation:
To maximize the height of the triangle, we need to distribute the red and blue balls in a way that allows us to form the maximum number of rows. We can achieve this by distributing the balls in alternating colors in a way that maximizes the number of rows.

1. Calculate the minimum number of balls required to form a complete row: `row = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2`
2. Start with the smaller count of balls (red or blue) and calculate the maximum possible height using the formula: `height = (int) (Math.sqrt(2 * totalBalls + 0.25) - 0.5)`
3. Check if the calculated height is valid for both colors. If it is, return the minimum of the two heights as the result.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxHeight(int red, int blue) {
        int totalBalls = red + blue;
        int heightRed = (int) (Math.sqrt(2 * red + 0.25) - 0.5);
        int heightBlue = (int) (Math.sqrt(2 * blue + 0.25) - 0.5);
        return Math.min(heightRed, heightBlue);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxHeight(int red, int blue) {
        int totalBalls = red + blue;
        int heightRed = (int) (sqrt(2 * red + 0.25) - 0.5);
        int heightBlue = (int) (sqrt(2 * blue + 0.25) - 0.5);
        return min(heightRed, heightBlue);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxHeight(self, red: int, blue: int) -> int:
        total_balls = red + blue
        height_red = int((2 * red + 0.25) ** 0.5 - 0.5)
        height_blue = int((2 * blue + 0.25) ** 0.5 - 0.5)
        return min(height_red, height_blue)
```
