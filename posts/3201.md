### Explanation
To find the maximum length of a valid subsequence in the given array, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum length of a valid subsequence ending at each index. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `nums.length` to store the maximum length of a valid subsequence ending at each index.
2. Initialize all elements of `dp` to 2, as a subsequence of length 2 is always valid.
3. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
4. For each element at index `i`, check if the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i-1]` is even.
5. If it is even, update `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`, as we can extend the valid subsequence ending at index `i`.
6. Otherwise, leave `dp[i]` as is, as we cannot extend the valid subsequence ending at index `i`.
7. Finally, return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest valid subsequence.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubsequenceLength(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 2);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if ((nums[i] - nums[i-1]) % 2 == 0) {
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        int maxLen = Arrays.stream(dp).max().getAsInt();
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubsequenceLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 2);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if ((nums[i] - nums[i-1]) % 2 == 0) {
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubsequenceLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [2] * n
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            if (nums[i] - nums[i-1]) % 2 == 0:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
        
        return max(dp)
```
