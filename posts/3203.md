### Explanation
To find the minimum diameter after merging two trees, we need to connect one node from the first tree to another node from the second tree. The diameter of a tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. 

We can solve this problem by first finding the diameter of each individual tree, then considering all possible connections between the two trees. The minimum possible diameter of the resulting tree is the minimum of the following:
1. Maximum diameter of the first tree
2. Maximum diameter of the second tree
3. Longest path between a node from the first tree and a node from the second tree

We can find the diameter of a tree using Depth First Search (DFS) to find the farthest node from a starting node, and then running DFS again from this farthest node to find the actual diameter.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMergingDiameter(int[][] edges1, int[][] edges2) {
        // Implement the solution here
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMergingDiameter(vector<vector<int>>& edges1, vector<vector<int>>& edges2) {
        // Implement the solution here
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minMergingDiameter(self, edges1: List[List[int]], edges2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Implement the solution here
```
