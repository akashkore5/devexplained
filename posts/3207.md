### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the enemy energies and keep track of the maximum points we can achieve by making optimal choices. We can use a greedy approach where we choose the unmarked enemy with the highest energy that we can defeat with our current energy.

1. Sort the enemy energies in non-increasing order.
2. Iterate through the sorted enemy energies:
   - If our current energy is greater than or equal to the enemy's energy, we defeat the enemy and gain 1 point.
   - Otherwise, we increase our energy by defeating marked enemies until we can defeat the current enemy.
3. Return the total points obtained.

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting the enemy energies.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[] enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
        Arrays.sort(enemyEnergies);
        int points = 0;
        for (int enemy : enemyEnergies) {
            if (currentEnergy >= enemy) {
                points++;
                currentEnergy -= enemy;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return points;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPoints(std::vector<int>& enemyEnergies, int currentEnergy) {
        std::sort(enemyEnergies.begin(), enemyEnergies.end(), std::greater<int>());
        int points = 0;
        for (int enemy : enemyEnergies) {
            if (currentEnergy >= enemy) {
                points++;
                currentEnergy -= enemy;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return points;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, enemyEnergies: List[int], currentEnergy: int) -> int:
        enemyEnergies.sort(reverse=True)
        points = 0
        for enemy in enemyEnergies:
            if currentEnergy >= enemy:
                points += 1
                currentEnergy -= enemy
            else:
                break
        return points
```
