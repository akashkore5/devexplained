## Explanation
To generate all valid binary strings without adjacent zeros, we can use backtracking. We start with an empty string and recursively build up the binary string by appending either '0' or '1' as long as the current substring doesn't contain adjacent zeros. We backtrack if we reach a point where adding '0' would create adjacent zeros.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the valid binary strings.
2. Start the backtracking process with an empty string and the target length n.
3. At each step, we have two choices: append '0' or '1' to the current string.
4. If the current string doesn't violate the condition of having adjacent zeros, continue with the next recursive call.
5. If the current string reaches the target length, add it to the list of valid binary strings.
6. Backtrack by removing the last character added before returning from the recursive call.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n) since for each position in the binary string, we have two choices ('0' or '1').

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive call stack.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateBinaryStrings(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        generate("", n, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void generate(String current, int n, List<String> result) {
        if (current.length() == n) {
            result.add(current);
            return;
        }
        
        if (current.length() == 0 || current.charAt(current.length() - 1) == '1') {
            generate(current + "0", n, result);
        }
        
        generate(current + "1", n, result);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generateBinaryStrings(int n) {
        vector<string> result;
        generate("", n, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    void generate(string current, int n, vector<string>& result) {
        if (current.length() == n) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }
        
        if (current.length() == 0 || current.back() == '1') {
            generate(current + "0", n, result);
        }
        
        generate(current + "1", n, result);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def generateBinaryStrings(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        
        def generate(current, n):
            if len(current) == n:
                result.append(current)
                return
            
            if len(current) == 0 or current[-1] == '1':
                generate(current + '0', n)
            
            generate(current + '1', n)
        
        generate("", n)
        return result
```
