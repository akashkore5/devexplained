### Explanation:
To calculate the year-on-year growth rate for a given array of numbers representing yearly revenue, we can use the formula: (current year revenue - previous year revenue) / previous year revenue * 100. We will iterate through the array once and calculate the growth rate for each pair of consecutive years.
:
```java
public double[] calculateYearOnYearGrowthRate(int[] revenue) {
    double[] growthRate = new double[revenue.length - 1];
    for (int i = 1; i < revenue.length; i++) {
        growthRate[i - 1] = ((double) revenue[i] - revenue[i - 1]) / revenue[i - 1] * 100;
    }
    return growthRate;
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<double> calculateYearOnYearGrowthRate(std::vector<int>& revenue) {
    std::vector<double> growthRate(revenue.size() - 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < revenue.size(); i++) {
        growthRate[i - 1] = ((double) revenue[i] - revenue[i - 1]) / revenue[i - 1] * 100;
    }
    return growthRate;
}
```

### Python:
```python
def calculateYearOnYearGrowthRate(revenue):
    growthRate = []
    for i in range(1, len(revenue)):
        growthRate.append((revenue[i] - revenue[i-1]) / revenue[i-1] * 100)
    return growthRate
```
