## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of amounts for odd and even transactions for each day. We can achieve this by using a SQL query that groups the transactions by date, calculates the sums for odd and even transactions separately, and then displays the results in the desired format.

Here are the steps of the algorithm:
1. Group the transactions by transaction_date.
2. Calculate the sum of amounts for odd transactions by filtering transactions with odd transaction_id.
3. Calculate the sum of amounts for even transactions by filtering transactions with even transaction_id.
4. Use the SQL COALESCE function to display 0 for days where there are no odd or even transactions.
5. Order the results by transaction_date in ascending order.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of transactions in the table. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT 
    t.transaction_date,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN t.transaction_id % 2 != 0 THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS odd_sum,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN t.transaction_id % 2 = 0 THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS even_sum
FROM transactions t
GROUP BY t.transaction_date
ORDER BY t.transaction_date;
```

### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT 
    transaction_date,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_id % 2 != 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS odd_sum,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_id % 2 = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS even_sum
FROM transactions
GROUP BY transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date;
```

### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT 
    transaction_date,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_id % 2 != 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS odd_sum,
    COALESCE(
        SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_id % 2 = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 0) AS even_sum
FROM transactions
GROUP BY transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date;
```
