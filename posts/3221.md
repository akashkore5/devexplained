## Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the maximum score we can achieve by hopping through an array of integers. Each element in the array represents the maximum number of steps we can take from that position. However, we also have to consider that some positions may have negative scores.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate through the array from right to left, keeping track of the maximum score we can achieve at each position. At each step, we consider two options: either we hop to the next position or skip it. We update our maximum score based on these two options.

Finally, the maximum score will be the value at the first position in the array.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[n-1] = nums[n-1];
        
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i] + (i+nums[i] < n ? dp[i+nums[i]] : 0), dp[i+1]);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 0);
        dp[n-1] = nums[n-1];
        
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + (i+nums[i] < n ? dp[i+nums[i]] : 0), dp[i+1]);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[n-1] = nums[n-1]
        
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + (i+nums[i] < n) * dp[i+nums[i]], dp[i+1])
        
        return dp[0]
```
