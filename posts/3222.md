## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the game between Alice and Bob. We can use a simple strategy where each player takes coins in such a way that the total value of coins taken in each turn is 115. If a player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.

We can implement a recursive function to represent the game where each player takes turns picking up coins until the game ends. The function will switch between players and keep track of the remaining number of coins for each type.

Based on the constraints of the problem, both players will play optimally, so we need to consider the best moves available at each turn to maximize their chances of winning.

### Algorithm:
1. Define a recursive function that takes the current player, remaining number of coins of each type, and a flag to indicate if it's Alice's turn.
2. If it's Alice's turn, try all possible moves by taking a certain number of coins of each type to reach a total value of 115. Recur for the next player.
3. If it's Bob's turn, do the same as Alice but switch the player.
4. If a player is unable to make a move, return the other player as the winner.
5. Keep track of the number of coins remaining for each player. If both players exhaust all their coins without reaching a total of 115, return "Draw".

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is exponential due to the recursive nature of exploring all possible moves. It is bounded by O(2^(x+y)).

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also exponential, as the recursion depth can go up to the total number of coins available. It is bounded by O(x+y).

```java
class Solution {
    public String findWinner(int x, int y) {
        return playGame(x, y, true) ? "Alice" : "Bob";
    }
    
    private boolean playGame(int x, int y, boolean isAlicesTurn) {
        if (x >= 1 && y >= 4 && isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y - 4, false);
        } else if (x >= 1 && y >= 4 && !isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y - 4, true);
        } else if (x >= 1 && y < 4 && isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y, false);
        } else if (x >= 1 && y < 4 && !isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y, true);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    string findWinner(int x, int y) {
        return playGame(x, y, true) ? "Alice" : "Bob";
    }
    
    bool playGame(int x, int y, bool isAlicesTurn) {
        if (x >= 1 && y >= 4 && isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y - 4, false);
        } else if (x >= 1 && y >= 4 && !isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y - 4, true);
        } else if (x >= 1 && y < 4 && isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y, false);
        } else if (x >= 1 && y < 4 && !isAlicesTurn) {
            return !playGame(x - 1, y, true);
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def find_winner(self, x: int, y: int) -> str:
        def play_game(x, y, is_alices_turn):
            if x >= 1 and y >= 4 and is_alices_turn:
                return not play_game(x - 1, y - 4, False)
            elif x >= 1 and y >= 4 and not is_alices_turn:
                return not play_game(x - 1, y - 4, True)
            elif x >= 1 and y < 4 and is_alices_turn:
                return not play_game(x - 1, y, False)
            elif x >= 1 and y < 4 and not is_alices_turn:
                return not play_game(x - 1, y, True)
            else:
                return False
        
        return "Alice" if play_game(x, y, True) else "Bob"
