### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of removing characters according to the given rules. We can iterate through the string and keep track of the indices of the characters that have duplicates on both sides. We can then remove the characters at those indices to minimize the length of the final string.

1. Iterate through the string and keep track of the indices of characters that have duplicates on both sides.
2. Remove the characters at those indices to minimize the length of the final string.
3. Repeat the above steps until there are no more characters that can be removed according to the rules.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the indices of characters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        boolean removed = true;

        while (removed) {
            int n = sb.length();
            removed = false;

            for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
                if (sb.charAt(i - 1) == sb.charAt(i) || sb.charAt(i) == sb.charAt(i + 1)) {
                    sb.delete(i - 1, i + 2);
                    removed = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return sb.length();
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        string str = s;
        bool removed = true;

        while (removed) {
            int n = str.length();
            removed = false;

            for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
                if (str[i - 1] == str[i] || str[i] == str[i + 1]) {
                    str.erase(i - 1, 3);
                    removed = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return str.length();
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        removed = True
        sb = list(s)

        while removed:
            n = len(sb)
            removed = False

            i = 1
            while i < n - 1:
                if sb[i - 1] == sb[i] or sb[i] == sb[i + 1]:
                    del sb[i-1:i+2]
                    removed = True
                    break
                i += 1

        return len(sb)
```
