## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to compare the binary representations of integers `n` and `k`. We iterate through the bits of `n` and `k` simultaneously. If a bit in `n` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `k` is 0, we need to change that bit. We can count the number of changes needed and return it as the result. If at any point we encounter a situation where `n` has more 1s than `k`, it is impossible to make `n` equal to `k` and we return -1.

- Time complexity: O(log(max(n, k)))
- Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int n, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0 || k > 0) {
            if ((n & 1) == 1 && (k & 1) == 0) {
                count++;
            }
            n >>= 1;
            k >>= 1;
        }
        return (n > 0) ? -1 : count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(int n, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0 || k > 0) {
            if ((n & 1) == 1 && (k & 1) == 0) {
                count++;
            }
            n >>= 1;
            k >>= 1;
        }
        return (n > 0) ? -1 : count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n > 0 or k > 0:
            if n & 1 == 1 and k & 1 == 0:
                count += 1
            n >>= 1
            k >>= 1
        return -1 if n > 0 else count
