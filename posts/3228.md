### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given binary string `s` and count the number of operations we can perform. Whenever we encounter a situation where `s[i] == '1'` and `s[i + 1] == '0'`, we increment the count of operations. The maximum number of operations we can perform is the number of such situations we encounter.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `operations` to 0.
2. Iterate through the binary string `s`.
3. If `s[i] == '1'` and `s[i + 1] == '0'`, increment `operations`.
4. Return the final value of `operations`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input binary string `s`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(String s) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1' && s.charAt(i + 1) == '0') {
                operations++;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(string s) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            if (s[i] == '1' && s[i + 1] == '0') {
                operations++;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        operations = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == '1' and s[i + 1] == '0':
                operations += 1
        return operations
```
