### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the arrays `nums` and `target` simultaneously. For each pair of elements, we calculate the difference between them and add the absolute difference to a sum variable. This sum represents the total number of operations required to make `nums` equal to `target`.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize a variable `operations` to 0.
2. Iterate through the arrays `nums` and `target` simultaneously.
3. For each pair of elements `nums[i]` and `target[i]`, calculate the absolute difference `diff = abs(nums[i] - target[i]` and add it to `operations`.
4. Return `operations`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the arrays `nums` and `target`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int[] target) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            operations += Math.abs(nums[i] - target[i]);
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& target) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            operations += abs(nums[i] - target[i]);
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], target: List[int]) -> int:
        operations = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            operations += abs(nums[i] - target[i])
        return operations
```
