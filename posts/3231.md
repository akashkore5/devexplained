## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate through the array and for each element, we will keep track of the maximum increasing subsequence ending at that element. Then, we can iterate backwards through the array to find the maximum increasing subsequence starting from each element. By combining these two values, we can get the length of the longest increasing subsequence that includes each element. The minimum number of elements to remove will be the total number of elements minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize two arrays `incFromLeft` and `incFromRight` of size equal to the input array.
2. Fill `incFromLeft` array by finding the maximum increasing subsequence ending at each element from left to right.
3. Fill `incFromRight` array by finding the maximum increasing subsequence starting at each element from right to left.
4. For each element in the array, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence that includes that element.
5. Return the minimum number of elements to be removed, which is the total number of elements minus the maximum length found in step 4.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

    public int minNumberToRemove(int[] nums) {

        // Find the maximum increasing subsequence ending at each element from left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            incFromLeft[i] = 1;
