## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first traversal of the tree while keeping track of the time each node gets marked. We can use a recursive function to propagate the marking time to the adjacent nodes based on the rules provided in the problem.

1. Start by initializing an array `times` to store the marking times for each node.
2. Define a recursive function `dfs` that takes the current node, its parent, and the current time as parameters.
3. In the `dfs` function, check if the current node is odd or even, and mark it accordingly based on its neighbors.
4. Recur for all the adjacent nodes of the current node, passing the appropriate time based on whether the node is odd or even.
5. Return the maximum time encountered during the traversal.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is also O(N) for the recursive stack.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] timeTakenToMarkAllNodes(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        int[] times = new int[n];
        dfs(0, -1, 0, graph, times);
        return times;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int node, int parent, int time, List<List<Integer>> graph, int[] times) {
        if (node % 2 == 0) {
            times[node] = Math.max(2, time + 2);
        } else {
            times[node] = Math.max(1, time + 1);
        }
        
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                times[node] = Math.max(times[node], dfs(neighbor, node, times[node], graph, times));
            }
        }
        
        return times[node];
    }
}
```

```cpp

public:
    vector<int> timeTakenToMarkAllNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        for (auto edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        vector<int> times(n);
        dfs(0, -1, 0, graph, times);
        return times;
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(int node, int parent, int time, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& times) {
        if (node % 2 == 0) {
            times[node] = max(2, time + 2);
        } else {
            times[node] = max(1, time + 1);
        }
        
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                times[node] = max(times[node], dfs(neighbor, node, times[node], graph, times));
            }
        }
        
        return times[node];
    }

            graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
            graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
