### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1 after each query. Initially, we have a unidirectional road from city i to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1. We can represent this as a graph where each city is a node and each road is a directed edge.

For each query, we add a new road from city ui to city vi and update the graph. Then, we run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1. We repeat this process for each query and store the length of the shortest path after each query.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] shortestDistance(int n, int[][] queries) {
        List<Integer>[] adjList = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjList[i] = new ArrayList<>();
            if (i < n - 1) {
                adjList[i].add(i + 1);
            }
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        int[] distances = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distances, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distances[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int u = queries[i][0];
            int v = queries[i][1];
            adjList[u].add(v);
            
            PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> distances[a] - distances[b]);
            pq.offer(0);
            
            while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                int curr = pq.poll();
                for (int neighbor : adjList[curr]) {
                    int newDist = distances[curr] + 1;
                    if (newDist < distances[neighbor]) {
                        distances[neighbor] = newDist;
                        pq.offer(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
            
            result[i] = distances[n - 1];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestDistance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<vector<int>> adjList(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjList[i].push_back(i + 1);
        }
        
        vector<int> result;
        vector<int> distances(n, INT_MAX);
        distances[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            int u = queries[i][0];
            int v = queries[i][1];
            adjList[u].push_back(v);
            
            priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
            pq.push({0, 0});
            
            while (!pq.empty()) {
                auto [dist, curr] = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                for (int neighbor : adjList[curr]) {
                    int newDist = distances[curr] + 1;
                    if (newDist < distances[neighbor]) {
                        distances[neighbor] = newDist;
                        pq.push({newDist, neighbor});
                    }
                }
            }
            
            result.push_back(distances[n - 1]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, n: int, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n - 1):
            adj_list[i].append(i + 1)
        
        result = []
        distances = [float('inf')] * n
        distances[0] = 0
        
        for query in queries:
            u, v = query
            adj_list[u].append(v)
            
            pq = [(0, 0)]
            while pq:
                dist, curr = heapq.heappop(pq)
                for neighbor in adj_list[curr]:
                    new_dist = distances[curr] + 1
                    if new_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                        distances[neighbor] = new_dist
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor))
            
            result.append(distances[n - 1])
        
        return result
```

In all three solutions, we maintain a graph representation using an adjacency list, update the graph with each query, run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path, and store the length of the shortest path after each query.
