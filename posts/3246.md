## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to implement a Premier League table ranking system. We can create a class representing a team with its name, number of wins, number of draws, and number of losses. We can then sort the teams based on their points, where a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point, and a loss gives 0 points. In case of a tie in points, we can use goal difference as a tiebreaker.

1. Create a Team class with name, wins, draws, losses, goalsFor, and goalsAgainst attributes.
2. Parse the input data to create Team objects and update their statistics.
3. Sort the teams based on points and goal difference.
4. Generate the final ranking based on the sorted teams.

Time complexity: O(nlogn) - sorting the teams
Space complexity: O(n) - storing team objects
```java
import java.util.*;

class Team {
    String name;
    int wins;
    int draws;
    int losses;
    int goalsFor;
    int goalsAgainst;

    public Team(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.wins = 0;
        this.draws = 0;
        this.losses = 0;
        this.goalsFor = 0;
        this.goalsAgainst = 0;
    }

    public int getPoints() {
        return wins * 3 + draws;
    }

    public int getGoalDifference() {
        return goalsFor - goalsAgainst;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public List<String> premierLeagueTable(String[][] results) {
