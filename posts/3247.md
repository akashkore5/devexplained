### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can iterate over the array and for each element, we can either include it in a subsequence or not include it. We can keep track of the count of subsequences ending at the current element with an even sum and the count of subsequences ending at the current element with an odd sum.

For each element, we can update the count of subsequences with even and odd sums based on the current element. At the end, we sum up all the subsequences with odd sums as our final result.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
        long even = 1, odd = 0, res = 0, sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (sum % 2 == 0) {
                even++;
            } else {
                res = (res + even) % mod;
                odd++;
            }
        }
        
        return (int)res;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long even = 1, odd = 0, res = 0, sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (sum % 2 == 0) {
                even++;
            } else {
                res = (res + even) % mod;
                odd++;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def numOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        even, odd, res, total = 1, 0, 0, 0
        
        for num in nums:
            total += num
            if total % 2 == 0:
                even += 1
            else:
                res = (res + even) % mod
                odd += 1
        
        return res
```
