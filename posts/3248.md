### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the movement of the snake based on the given commands. We maintain the current position of the snake and update it according to each command. We need to handle the boundary conditions to ensure that the snake stays within the grid.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables for current position (start at cell 0), and iterate through each command.
2. For each command:
   - Update the position based on the command direction.
   - Check if the new position is within the grid boundaries.
3. Return the final position of the snake.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of commands given.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int finalPosition(int n, String[] commands) {
        int position = 0;
        
        for (String command : commands) {
            switch (command) {
                case "UP":
                    if (position - n >= 0) {
                        position -= n;
                    }
                    break;
                case "RIGHT":
                    if ((position + 1) % n != 0) {
                        position++;
                    }
                    break;
                case "DOWN":
                    if (position + n < n * n) {
                        position += n;
                    }
                    break;
                case "LEFT":
                    if (position % n != 0) {
                        position--;
                    }
                    break;
            }
        }
        
        return position;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int finalPosition(int n, vector<string>& commands) {
        int position = 0;
        
        for (const string& command : commands) {
            if (command == "UP" && position - n >= 0) {
                position -= n;
            } else if (command == "RIGHT" && (position + 1) % n != 0) {
                position++;
            } else if (command == "DOWN" && position + n < n * n) {
                position += n;
            } else if (command == "LEFT" && position % n != 0) {
                position--;
            }
        }
        
        return position;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def finalPosition(self, n: int, commands: List[str]) -> int:
        position = 0
        
        for command in commands:
            if command == "UP" and position - n >= 0:
                position -= n
            elif command == "RIGHT" and (position + 1) % n != 0:
                position += 1
            elif command == "DOWN" and position + n < n * n:
                position += n
            elif command == "LEFT" and position % n != 0:
                position -= 1
        
        return position
```
