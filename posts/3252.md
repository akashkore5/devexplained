### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the matches played and update the team standings accordingly. We will maintain a map to store the team standings based on their points, goals scored, and goal difference. We will iterate through the matches and update the standings for each team based on the match results. Finally, we will sort the teams based on the defined criteria to get the final ranking.

1. Create a map to store team standings with team name as the key and a custom class or tuple containing points, goals scored, and goal difference as the value.
2. Iterate through each match and update the standings for the teams involved in the match.
3. After processing all matches, sort the teams based on the defined criteria (points, goals scored, goal difference) to get the final ranking.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - Sorting all teams at the end
Space Complexity: O(n) - Using a map to store team standings
