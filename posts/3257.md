### Explanation:
To maximize the sum of values in the cells where the rooks are placed, we need to strategically place the rooks such that they do not attack each other. In this problem, we are asked to place three rooks on a chessboard with given values in each cell.

We can solve this problem by iterating through each possible combination of three non-attacking positions for the rooks on the chessboard. For each combination, we calculate the sum of values in those cells and keep track of the maximum sum found.

To ensure that the rooks do not attack each other, we can check if any two rooks are in the same row or column. If they are, we skip that combination.

After considering all possible combinations, we return the maximum sum found.

**Time Complexity:** O(m^3 * n^3), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the chessboard.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxThreeRooks(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length;
        int n = board[0].length;
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int r1 = 0; r1 < m; r1++) {
            for (int c1 = 0; c1 < n; c1++) {
                for (int r2 = 0; r2 < m; r2++) {
                    for (int c2 = 0; c2 < n; c2++) {
                        for (int r3 = 0; r3 < m; r3++) {
                            for (int c3 = 0; c3 < n; c3++) {
                                if (r1 != r2 && r2 != r3 && r1 != r3 && c1 != c2 && c2 != c3 && c1 != c3) {
                                    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, board[r1][c1] + board[r2][c2] + board[r3][c3]);
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
