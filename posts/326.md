### Explanation
To determine if a given number is a power of three, we can repeatedly divide the number by 3 until we reach 1. If at any point the number is not divisible by 3 or if we reach 1, then the original number is not a power of three. The constraints allow us to use a mathematical approach without loops or recursion.

```java
public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    return n > 0 && 1162261467 % n == 0;
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return n > 0 && 1162261467 % n == 0;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and 1162261467 % n == 0
```
