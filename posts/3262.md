## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can sort the shifts based on their start times. Then, we iterate through the sorted shifts and check for overlapping shifts. If the end time of the current shift is greater than the start time of the next shift, it indicates an overlap. We keep track of the maximum number of overlapping shifts at any given time.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of shifts\
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int findOverlappingShifts(int[][] shifts) {
        Arrays.sort(shifts, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        int maxOverlapping = 0;
        int currentOverlapping = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < shifts.length - 1; i++) {
            if (shifts[i][1] > shifts[i + 1][0]) {
                currentOverlapping++;
                maxOverlapping = Math.max(maxOverlapping, currentOverlapping);
            } else {
                currentOverlapping = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxOverlapping;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int findOverlappingShifts(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& shifts) {
        std::sort(shifts.begin(), shifts.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });
        
        int maxOverlapping = 0;
        int currentOverlapping = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < shifts.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (shifts[i][1] > shifts[i + 1][0]) {
                currentOverlapping++;
                maxOverlapping = std::max(maxOverlapping, currentOverlapping);
            } else {
                currentOverlapping = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxOverlapping;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findOverlappingShifts(self, shifts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        shifts.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        max_overlapping = 0
        current_overlapping = 0
        
        for i in range(len(shifts) - 1):
            if shifts[i][1] > shifts[i + 1][0]:
                current_overlapping += 1
                max_overlapping = max(max_overlapping, current_overlapping)
            else:
                current_overlapping = 0
        
        return max_overlapping
```
