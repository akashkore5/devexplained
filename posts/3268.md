### Explanation

We are given a list of shifts represented as intervals. Our task is to find the maximum number of overlapping shifts at any point in time.

To solve this problem, we need to sort the shifts based on their start times and end times separately. Then we can iterate through the sorted lists and keep track of the number of overlapping shifts at each time point.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int findOverlappingShifts(int[][] shifts) {
        List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] shift : shifts) {
            events.add(new int[]{shift[0], 1});
            events.add(new int[]{shift[1], -1});
        }
        
        Collections.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] != b[0] ? a[0] - b[0] : b[1] - a[1]);
        
        int overlap = 0, maxOverlap = 0;
        for (int[] event : events) {
            overlap += event[1];
            maxOverlap = Math.max(maxOverlap, overlap);
        }
        
        return maxOverlap;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int findOverlappingShifts(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& shifts) {
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> events;
        for (auto& shift : shifts) {
            events.push_back({shift[0], 1});
            events.push_back({shift[1], -1});
        }
        
        std::sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
            return a.first != b.first ? a.first < b.first : b.second < a.second;
        });
        
        int overlap = 0, maxOverlap = 0;
        for (auto& event : events) {
            overlap += event.second;
            maxOverlap = std::max(maxOverlap, overlap);
        }
        
        return maxOverlap;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findOverlappingShifts(self, shifts: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        events = []
        for shift in shifts:
            events.append((shift[0], 1))
            events.append((shift[1], -1))
        
        events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        
        overlap = 0
        max_overlap = 0
        for event in events:
            overlap += event[1]
            max_overlap = max(max_overlap, overlap)
        
        return max_overlap
```
