### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate through the array from left to right. For each element, we iterate through the subsequent elements to find the first element that is smaller than the current element. If found, we update the current element by subtracting the found element from it. If no smaller element is found, the current element remains unchanged.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] finalPrices(int[] prices) {
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int discount = 0;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                if (prices[j] <= prices[i]) {
                    discount = prices[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
            prices[i] -= discount;
        }
        return prices;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> finalPrices(vector<int>& prices) {
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            int discount = 0;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.size(); j++) {
                if (prices[j] <= prices[i]) {
                    discount = prices[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
            prices[i] -= discount;
        }
        return prices;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            discount = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                if prices[j] <= prices[i]:
                    discount = prices[j]
                    break
            prices[i] -= discount
        return prices
```
