### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the reduction of the mountain's height by the workers. We iterate through each worker and calculate the time taken to reduce the height by each possible amount. We then find the maximum time taken by all workers to reduce the mountain's height to zero.

1. Initialize a variable `totalSeconds` to 0.
2. For each worker, calculate the time taken to reduce the mountain's height by each possible amount using the formula given in the problem.
3. Keep track of the maximum time taken by any worker to reduce the mountain's height to zero.
4. Return the maximum time taken as the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain zero.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `workerTimes` array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSeconds(int mountainHeight, int[] workerTimes) {
        int totalSeconds = 0;
        
        for (int time : workerTimes) {
            int currTime = 0;
            for (int x = 1; x <= mountainHeight; x++) {
                currTime += time * x;
                totalSeconds = Math.max(totalSeconds, currTime);
            }
        }
        
        return totalSeconds;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSeconds(int mountainHeight, vector<int>& workerTimes) {
        int totalSeconds = 0;
        
        for (int time : workerTimes) {
            int currTime = 0;
            for (int x = 1; x <= mountainHeight; x++) {
                currTime += time * x;
                totalSeconds = max(totalSeconds, currTime);
            }
        }
        
        return totalSeconds;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minSeconds(self, mountainHeight: int, workerTimes: List[int]) -> int:
        totalSeconds = 0
        
        for time in workerTimes:
            currTime = 0
            for x in range(1, mountainHeight + 1):
                currTime += time * x
                totalSeconds = max(totalSeconds, currTime)
                
        return totalSeconds
