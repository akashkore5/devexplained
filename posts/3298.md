### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We iterate over each character in `word1` and maintain a count of characters seen so far. For each character, we update our count and check if the current window of characters can be rearranged to form `word2`. We do this by comparing the count of characters in the window with the count of characters in `word2`.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize variables `result`, `countWord1` and `countWord2` to keep track of the total valid substrings, the count of characters in the current window, and the count of characters in `word2` respectively.
2. Iterate over each character in `word1` and update the count of that character in the window.
3. Check if the window size is greater than or equal to the length of `word2`.
4. If the window size is greater than the length of `word2`, we remove the first character from the window and update the counts accordingly.
5. Check if the counts of characters in the window match the counts of characters in `word2`. If they match, increment the `result`.
6. Return the final `result`.

**Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of `word1`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String word1, String word2) {
        int result = 0;
        int[] countWord1 = new int[26];
        int[] countWord2 = new int[26];
        
        for (char c : word2.toCharArray()) {
            countWord2[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int left = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < word1.length(); right++) {
            char curr = word1.charAt(right);
            countWord1[curr - 'a']++;
            
            if (right - left + 1 > word2.length()) {
                char leftChar = word1.charAt(left);
                countWord1[leftChar - 'a']--;
                left++;
            }
            
            if (right - left + 1 == word2.length()) {
                if (Arrays.equals(countWord1, countWord2)) {
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

        vector<int> countWord1(26, 0);
        vector<int> countWord2(26, 0);
        
        for (char c : word2) {
            countWord2[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int left = 0;
