### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all consecutive subsequences in a given array. One way to approach this is by considering all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < n. For each pair, we calculate the sum of elements between i and j and add it to the total sum.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Initialize a variable `totalSum` to store the final result.
2. Iterate over all possible pairs of indices (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < n.
3. For each pair, calculate the sum of elements between i and j and add it to `totalSum`.
4. Return `totalSum` as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfConsecutiveSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                    sum += nums[k];
                }
                totalSum += sum;
            }
        }
        
        return totalSum;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfConsecutiveSubsequences(vector<int>& nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                    sum += nums[k];
                }
                totalSum += sum;
            }
        }
        
        return totalSum;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfConsecutiveSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        totalSum = 0
        n = len(nums)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                sum_val = 0
                for k in range(i, j + 1):
                    sum_val += nums[k]
                totalSum += sum_val
                
        return totalSum
