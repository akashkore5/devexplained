### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iteratively build up the range `[1, n]` using the existing elements in the array `nums`. We can do this by keeping track of the maximum reachable value `reachable` from the elements we have processed so far. If the next element in `nums` is greater than `reachable + 1`, we need to add a patch to the array to cover the gap between `reachable + 1` and the next element. By adding a patch, we can extend the range that can be formed by summing the elements in the array.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize the variables `patchCount` to 0, `reachable` to 0, and `index` to 0.
2. While `reachable` is less than `n`, check if the current element in `nums` at index `index` is less than or equal to `reachable + 1`. If it is, update `reachable` to `reachable + nums[index]` and move to the next element.
3. If the current element in `nums` is greater than `reachable + 1`, increment `patchCount`, add `reachable + 1` to the array, and update `reachable` to `2 * reachable + 1`.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `reachable` is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. Return the `patchCount`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(n)) since the number of patches required grows logarithmically with `n`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPatches(int[] nums, int n) {
        long reachable = 0;
        int patchCount = 0;
        int index = 0;

        while (reachable < n) {
            if (index < nums.length && nums[index] <= reachable + 1) {
                reachable += nums[index];
                index++;
            } else {
                patchCount++;
                reachable = 2 * reachable + 1;
            }
        }

        return patchCount;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        long reachable = 0;
        int patchCount = 0;
        int index = 0;

        while (reachable < n) {
            if (index < nums.size() && nums[index] <= reachable + 1) {
                reachable += nums[index];
                index++;
            } else {
                patchCount++;
                reachable = 2 * reachable + 1;
            }
        }

        return patchCount;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        reachable = 0
        patchCount = 0
        index = 0

        while reachable < n:
            if index < len(nums) and nums[index] <= reachable + 1:
                reachable += nums[index]
                index += 1
            else:
                patchCount += 1
                reachable = 2 * reachable + 1

        return patchCount
```
