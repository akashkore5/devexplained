### Explanation

To maximize the total height of unique towers, we need to assign heights to each tower such that the height of the ith tower is a positive integer and does not exceed `maximumHeight[i]`, and no two towers have the same height. We can achieve this by sorting the `maximumHeight` array in descending order and then assigning heights starting from 1 to the maximum height allowed for each tower. If at any point we find that the maximum height for a tower is less than the current height we are trying to assign, we return -1 as it is not possible to assign unique heights in this scenario.

- Sort the `maximumHeight` array in descending order.
- Iterate over the sorted array and assign heights from 1 upwards to each tower, making sure that the assigned height does not exceed the maximum height allowed.
- If at any point we find that the maximum height for a tower is less than the current height we are trying to assign, return -1.
- Calculate and return the total sum of tower heights.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the `maximumHeight` array due to sorting.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maximizeTowerHeights(int[] maximumHeight) {
        Arrays.sort(maximumHeight);
        int n = maximumHeight.length;
        int totalHeight = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int height = Math.min(i + 1, maximumHeight[i]);
            if (height < i + 1) {
                return -1;
            }
            totalHeight += height;
        }

        return totalHeight;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeTowerHeights(std::vector<int>& maximumHeight) {
        std::sort(maximumHeight.begin(), maximumHeight.end(), std::greater<int>());
        int n = maximumHeight.size();
        int totalHeight = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int height = std::min(i + 1, maximumHeight[i]);
            if (height < i + 1) {
                return -1;
            }
            totalHeight += height;
        }

        return totalHeight;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeTowerHeights(self, maximumHeight: List[int]) -> int:
        maximumHeight.sort(reverse=True)
        total_height = 0

        for i in range(len(maximumHeight)):
            height = min(i + 1, maximumHeight[i])
            if height < i + 1:
                return -1
            total_height += height

        return total_height
```
