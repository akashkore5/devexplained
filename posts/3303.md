## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will iterate through the string `s` using a window of size equal to the length of `pattern`. At each step, we will check if the current substring within the window is almost equal to the `pattern` by allowing at most one character to be different. 

We will keep track of the number of differences between the current substring and the `pattern`. If the number of differences is greater than 1, we will shrink the window by incrementing the left pointer. If the number of differences is at most 1, we will update the minimum starting index of the substring that is almost equal to the `pattern`.

Finally, we return the smallest starting index found or -1 if no such index exists.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheOccurrenceOfFirstAlmostEqualSubstring(String s, String pattern) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int diffCount = 0;
        int minStart = -1;
        
        while (right < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(right) != pattern.charAt(right)) {
                diffCount++;
            }
            while (diffCount > 1) {
                if (s.charAt(left) != pattern.charAt(left)) {
                    diffCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            if (right - left + 1 == pattern.length()) {
                if (minStart == -1 || left < minStart) {
                    minStart = left;
                }
            }
            right++;
        }
        
        return minStart;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheOccurrenceOfFirstAlmostEqualSubstring(string s, string pattern) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int diffCount = 0;
        int minStart = -1;
        
        while (right < s.length()) {
            if (s[right] != pattern[right]) {
                diffCount++;
            }
            while (diffCount > 1) {
                if (s[left] != pattern[left]) {
                    diffCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            if (right - left + 1 == pattern.length()) {
                if (minStart == -1 || left < minStart) {
                    minStart = left;
                }
            }
            right++;
        }
        
        return minStart;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheOccurrenceOfFirstAlmostEqualSubstring(self, s: str, pattern: str) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = 0
        diffCount = 0
        minStart = -1
        
        while right < len(s):
            if s[right] != pattern[right]:
                diffCount += 1
            while diffCount > 1:
                if s[left] != pattern[left]:
                    diffCount -= 1
                left += 1
            if right - left + 1 == len(pattern):
                if minStart == -1 or left < minStart:
                    minStart = left
            right += 1
        
        return minStart
