## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of generating new strings by changing each character to its next character in the English alphabet until the word has at least k characters. We can keep track of the current index in the generated string and update it accordingly. Finally, we return the k-th character in the word.

- We initialize the word as "a" and the current index as 1.
- We iterate from 1 to k, generating new strings by changing each character to its next character and appending it to the original word.
- We update the current index based on the length of the generated string.
- Finally, we return the k-th character in the word.

Time complexity: O(k)
Space complexity: O(k)
```java
class Solution {
    public char findKthCharacter(int k) {
        String word = "a";
        int currentIndex = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            char nextChar = (char)((word.charAt(currentIndex - 1) - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a');
            word += nextChar;
            currentIndex = word.length();
        }
        
        return word.charAt(k - 1);
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    char findKthCharacter(int k) {
        std::string word = "a";
        int currentIndex = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            char nextChar = (char)((word[currentIndex - 1] - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a');
            word += nextChar;
            currentIndex = word.length();
        }

        return word[k - 1];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthCharacter(self, k: int) -> str:
        word = "a"
        currentIndex = 1
        
        for i in range(1, k):
            nextChar = chr((ord(word[currentIndex - 1]) - ord('a') + 1) % 26 + ord('a'))
            word += nextChar
            currentIndex = len(word)
        
        return word[k - 1]
```
