### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the operations that Alice performs on the initial string. We can keep track of the length of the string after each operation and find the k-th character based on the number of operations performed. We can use modulo arithmetic to determine the position of the k-th character in the final string.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Initialize the string `word` with "a" and set the current length of the word to 1.
2. Iterate over the operations array and perform the specified operation.
3. For operation 0, double the length of the word.
4. For operation 1, increment each character in the word by one and append the resulting string to the original word.
5. Calculate the effective length of the word after all operations.
6. Find the k-th character in the final word using modulo arithmetic.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the operations array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the operations array.
```java
class Solution {
    public char findKthCharacter(int k, int[] operations) {
        String word = "a";
        int length = 1;
        
        for (int operation : operations) {
            if (operation == 0) {
                length *= 2;
            } else {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
                    sb.append((char) ((ch - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a'));
                }
                word += sb.toString();
            }
        }
        
        int effectiveLength = word.length();
        
        k--; // Convert k to 0-based index
        k %= effectiveLength;
        
        return word.charAt(k);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findKthCharacter(int k, vector<int>& operations) {
        string word = "a";
        int length = 1;
        
        for (int operation : operations) {
            if (operation == 0) {
                length *= 2;
            } else {
                string temp = "";
                for (char ch : word) {
                    temp += ((ch - 'a' + 1) % 26 + 'a');
                }
                word += temp;
            }
        }
        
        int effectiveLength = word.length();
        
        k--; // Convert k to 0-based index
        k %= effectiveLength;
        
        return word[k];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthCharacter(self, k: int, operations: List[int]) -> str:
        word = "a"
        length = 1
        
        for operation in operations:
            if operation == 0:
                length *= 2
            else:
                temp = ""
                for ch in word:
                    temp += chr((ord(ch) - ord('a') + 1) % 26 + ord('a'))
                word += temp
        
        effective_length = len(word)
        
        k -= 1  # Convert k to 0-based index
        k %= effective_length
        
        return word[k]
