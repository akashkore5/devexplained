## Explanation:
To find the top performing driver, we can iterate through the given list of drivers and calculate their performance score based on the given formula. We will keep track of the maximum performance score and the driver with the highest performance score. In case of ties, we will choose the driver with the lower index.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `maxScore` as -1 and `topDriver` as -1 to store the maximum performance score and the top performing driver's index.
2. Iterate through the list of drivers.
3. Calculate the performance score for each driver using the given formula.
4. If the current driver's performance score is greater than `maxScore`, update `maxScore` and `topDriver`.
5. If the current driver's performance score is equal to `maxScore`, update `topDriver` only if the current driver has a lower index.
6. Return the `topDriver` as the top performing driver.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of drivers in the input list.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.:
:
```java
public int findTopPerformingDriver(int[] driverScores) {
    int maxScore = -1;
    int topDriver = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < driverScores.length; i++) {
        int score = driverScores[i] * (i + 1);
        if (score > maxScore || (score == maxScore && i < topDriver)) {
            maxScore = score;
            topDriver = i;
        }
    }

    return topDriver;
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
int findTopPerformingDriver(vector<int>& driverScores) {
    int maxScore = -1;
    int topDriver = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < driverScores.size(); i++) {
        int score = driverScores[i] * (i + 1);
        if (score > maxScore || (score == maxScore && i < topDriver)) {
            maxScore = score;
            topDriver = i;
        }
    }

    return topDriver;
}
```

### Python:
```python
def find_top_performing_driver(driver_scores):
    max_score = -1
    top_driver = -1

    for i in range(len(driver_scores)):
        score = driver_scores[i] * (i + 1)
        if score > max_score or (score == max_score and i < top_driver):
            max_score = score
            top_driver = i

    return top_driver
```
