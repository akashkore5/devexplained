## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to identify and remove suspicious methods along with their dependencies. We will start by building a directed graph representing method invocations. Then, we will perform a DFS starting from the suspicious method k to mark all methods that are directly or indirectly invoked by k as suspicious. Finally, we will iterate through all methods and include only those that are not marked as suspicious in the final result.

### Algorithm:
1. Build a directed graph representing method invocations.
2. Perform DFS starting from the suspicious method k to mark all suspicious methods.
3. Iterate through all methods and include only those that are not marked as suspicious in the final result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n + m), where n is the number of methods and m is the number of invocations.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n + m) for storing the graph and the visited array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] removeMethods(int n, int k, int[][] invocations) {
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] invocation : invocations) {
            graph[invocation[0]].add(invocation[1]);
        }
        
        boolean[] suspicious = new boolean[n];
        dfs(graph, k, suspicious);
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!suspicious[i]) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
    }
    
    private void dfs(List<Integer>[] graph, int k, boolean[] suspicious) {
        suspicious[k] = true;
        for (int next : graph[k]) {
            if (!suspicious[next]) {
                dfs(graph, next, suspicious);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> removeMethods(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& invocations) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        for (const auto& invocation : invocations) {
            graph[invocation[0]].push_back(invocation[1]);
        }
        
        vector<bool> suspicious(n, false);
        dfs(graph, k, suspicious);
        
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!suspicious[i]) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int k, vector<bool>& suspicious) {
        suspicious[k] = true;
        for (int next : graph[k]) {
            if (!suspicious[next]) {
                dfs(graph, next, suspicious);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeMethods(self, n: int, k: int, invocations: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for invocation in invocations:
            graph[invocation[0]].append(invocation[1])
        
        suspicious = [False] * n
        self.dfs(graph, k, suspicious)
        
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            if not suspicious[i]:
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
    
    def dfs(self, graph: List[List[int]], k: int, suspicious: List[bool]) -> None:
        suspicious[k] = True
        for next_method in graph[k]:
            if not suspicious[next_method]:
                self.dfs(graph, next_method, suspicious)
