## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 3D array `dp` where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to assign stages and scores to the first `i` performers, with `j` stages and `k` scores. 

We can iterate over the performers and for each performer, we can iterate over the stages and scores, updating the `dp` array based on the previous state. The final answer will be the sum of all possible ways to assign stages and scores to all performers.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a 3D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (x+1) x (y+1)` with all values as 0.
2. Set `dp[0][0][0] = 1` as there is 1 way to assign stages and scores to 0 performers with 0 stages and 0 scores.
3. Iterate over performers from 1 to `n`:
   - Iterate over stages from 1 to `x`:
     - Iterate over scores from 1 to `y`:
       - Update `dp[i][j][k]` based on the previous state:
         - `dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i-1][j-1][k-1]) * j` (assigning performer `i` to a new stage and score)
         - `dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i-1][j][k]) * (i-j)` (assigning performer `i` to an existing stage and score)
4. Return the total number of ways as `dp[n][x][y] % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n * x * y) where n, x, and y are the given integers.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n * x * y) due to the 3D array `dp`.

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int countWays(int n, int x, int y) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n + 1][x + 1][y + 1];
        dp[0][0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= x; j++) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= y; k++) {
                    dp[i][j][k] = (int) (((long) dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - 1] * j + (long) dp[i - 1][j][k] * (i - j)) % MOD);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][x][y];
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countWays(int n, int x, int y) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n + 1, vector<vector<int>>(x + 1, vector<int>(y + 1)));
        dp[0][0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= x; j++) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= y; k++) {
                    dp[i][j][k] = ((long) dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - 1] * j + (long) dp[i - 1][j][k] * (i - j)) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][x][y];
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def countWays(self, n: int, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        dp = [[[0 for _ in range(y + 1)] for _ in range(x + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0][0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, x + 1):
                for k in range(1, y + 1):
                    dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - 1] * j + dp[i - 1][j][k] * (i - j)) % MOD
        return dp[n][x][y]
