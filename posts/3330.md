### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string `word` and count the number of occurrences of each character. For each character, we calculate the number of ways it can be typed (taking into account that it might have been typed multiple times). The total number of possible original strings is the product of the number of ways each character can be typed. We need to consider the cases where a character is typed once, twice, or more than twice. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int findOriginalString(String word) {
        int result = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            count++;
            if (i == word.length() - 1 || word.charAt(i) != word.charAt(i + 1)) {
                result *= count;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findOriginalString(string word) {
        int result = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            count++;
            if (i == word.length() - 1 || word[i] != word[i + 1]) {
                result *= count;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findOriginalString(self, word: str) -> int:
        result = 1
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(word)):
            count += 1
            if i == len(word) - 1 or word[i] != word[i + 1]:
                result *= count
                count = 0
        return result
```
