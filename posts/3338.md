### Explanation

To find the second highest salary in a table, we can use a simple SQL query that orders the salary in descending order and selects the second highest salary. If there are multiple records with the same highest salary, we want to exclude those from being considered as the second highest salary.
#### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
