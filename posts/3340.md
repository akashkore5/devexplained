### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and calculate the sums of digits at even and odd indices separately. If the two sums are equal, then the string is considered balanced. We can achieve this by iterating over the string and keeping track of the sums at even and odd indices.

- Initialize two variables `evenSum` and `oddSum` to keep track of the sums at even and odd indices.
- Iterate over the string, adding the digit to `evenSum` if the index is even and to `oddSum` if the index is odd.
- After iterating through the entire string, compare the two sums. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalancedString(String num) {
        int evenSum = 0, oddSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            int digit = num.charAt(i) - '0';
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                evenSum += digit;
            } else {
                oddSum += digit;
            }
        }
        return evenSum == oddSum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBalancedString(string num) {
        int evenSum = 0, oddSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            int digit = num[i] - '0';
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                evenSum += digit;
            } else {
                oddSum += digit;
            }
        }
        return evenSum == oddSum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalancedString(self, num: str) -> bool:
        evenSum = 0
        oddSum = 0
        for i in range(len(num)):
            digit = int(num[i])
            if i % 2 == 0:
                evenSum += digit
            else:
                oddSum += digit
        return evenSum == oddSum
```
