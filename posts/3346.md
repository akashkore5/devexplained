## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of performing the operations on the array `nums`. We will keep track of how many times each element appears in the array after each operation. We can do this by maintaining a map (or dictionary) where the keys are the elements in the array and the values are their frequencies. 

For each operation, we will select an index `i` that has not been selected before, and add a random integer in the range `[-k, k]` to `nums[i]`. We then update the frequency of the modified element in our map. Finally, we find the maximum frequency of any element in the map after all operations are performed.

After each operation, we need to update the frequencies in the map and keep track of the maximum frequency achieved.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k, int numOperations) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFreq = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numOperations; i++) {
            int index = (int)(Math.random() * nums.length);
            int diff = (int)(Math.random() * (2 * k + 1)) - k;
            
            nums[index] += diff;
            freqMap.put(nums[index], freqMap.getOrDefault(nums[index], 0) + 1);
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, freqMap.get(nums[index]));
        }
        
        return maxFreq;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cstdlib>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(std::vector<int>& nums, int k, int numOperations) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numOperations; i++) {
            int index = rand() % nums.size();
            int diff = rand() % (2 * k + 1) - k;
            
            nums[index] += diff;
            freqMap[nums[index]]++;
            maxFreq = std::max(maxFreq, freqMap[nums[index]]);
        }
        
        return maxFreq;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import random

class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int, numOperations: int) -> int:
        freqMap = {}
        maxFreq = 0
        
        for _ in range(numOperations):
            index = random.randint(0, len(nums) - 1)
            diff = random.randint(-k, k)
            
            nums[index] += diff
            freqMap[nums[index]] = freqMap.get(nums[index], 0) + 1
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freqMap[nums[index]])
        
        return maxFreq
```
