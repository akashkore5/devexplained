### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the minimum total operations required to reach a target number starting from 0. We are allowed to perform either of the two operations:
1. Add 1 to the current number.
2. Double the current number.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We should always try to double the current number as long as it is less than or equal to the target number. If the target number is odd, we should subtract 1 before doubling to ensure that we reach the target in the minimum number of operations.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                n /= 2;
            } else {
                n -= 1;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                n /= 2;
            } else {
                n -= 1;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n //= 2
            else:
                n -= 1
            count += 1
        return count
```
