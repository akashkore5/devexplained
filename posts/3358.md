## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find all the books with NULL ratings and return their IDs in a sorted order. We can iterate through the given list of books and check if the rating is NULL. If so, we add the book ID to our result list. Finally, we sort the result list before returning it.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Initialize an empty list to store the IDs of books with NULL ratings.
2. Iterate through the given list of books, check if the rating is NULL, and if so, add the book ID to the result list.
3. Sort the result list in ascending order.
4. Return the sorted list of book IDs.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn), where n is the number of books in the input list. The sorting operation accounts for the O(nlogn) complexity.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of books with NULL ratings.
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getBooksNullRatings(List<Book> books) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Book book : books) {
            if (book.getRating() == null) {
                result.add(book.getId());
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getBooksNullRatings(vector<Book>& books) {
        vector<int> result;
        for (const auto& book : books) {
            if (book.getRating() == nullptr) {
                result.push_back(book.getId());
            }
        }
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def get_books_null_ratings(self, books):
        result = []
        for book in books:
            if book.get_rating() is None:
                result.append(book.get_id())
        result.sort()
        return result
```

Note: You will need to implement the `Book` class with `getId()` and `getRating()` methods in your code for these solutions to work.
