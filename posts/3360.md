## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the game between Alice and Bob iteratively. We start with Alice removing 10 stones and then alternate turns between the two players, removing stones according to the rules until one player cannot make a move. We keep track of whose turn it is and the number of stones remaining. If the number of stones is less than 10 and it's Alice's turn, she loses.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `stones` to `n` and a boolean variable `aliceTurn` to `true`.
2. Iterate while `stones` is greater than 0:
   - If `aliceTurn` is `true`, Alice removes stones as per the rules.
   - If `aliceTurn` is `false`, Bob removes stones as per the rules.
   - Decrement the number of stones removed from `stones` and toggle `aliceTurn`.
3. If the loop ends with `aliceTurn` as `true`, return `true` (Alice wins); otherwise, return `false` (Alice loses).

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the input integer.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGame(int n) {
        int stones = n;
        boolean aliceTurn = true;

        while (stones > 0) {
            if (aliceTurn) {
                stones -= 10;
            } else {
                stones -= 11 - stones % 11;
            }
            aliceTurn = !aliceTurn;
        }

        return aliceTurn;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGame(int n) {
        int stones = n;
        bool aliceTurn = true;

        while (stones > 0) {
            if (aliceTurn) {
                stones -= 10;
            } else {
                stones -= 11 - stones % 11;
            }
            aliceTurn = !aliceTurn;
        }

        return aliceTurn;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def stoneGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        stones = n
        aliceTurn = True

        while stones > 0:
            if aliceTurn:
                stones -= 10
            else:
                stones -= 11 - stones % 11
            aliceTurn = not aliceTurn

        return aliceTurn
```
