### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the queries and update the count of operations required to convert the array to all zeros. We can track the maximum count of operations that can be removed. If at any point, the remaining operations are not sufficient to convert the array to all zeros, we return -1.

1. Initialize a variable `opsCount` to keep track of the total operations needed to convert the array to all zeros.
2. Iterate through the queries and update the count of operations required for each query.
3. If at any point, the remaining operations are not enough to convert the array to all zeros, return -1.
4. Calculate the maximum count of operations that can be removed by subtracting the minimum of the current count of operations and the number of operations needed for the current query.
5. Return the maximum count of operations that can be removed.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array `nums`.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int opsCount = 0;
        
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int minVal = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; i++) {
                minVal = Math.min(minVal, nums[i]);
            }
            opsCount += minVal;
        }
        
        int maxOpsRemoved = 0;
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int opsRemoved = Math.min(opsCount, query[1] - query[0] + 1);
            maxOpsRemoved = Math.max(maxOpsRemoved, opsRemoved);
        }
        
        return opsCount - maxOpsRemoved;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int opsCount = 0;
        
        for (auto query : queries) {
            int minVal = INT_MAX;
            for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; i++) {
                minVal = min(minVal, nums[i]);
            }
            opsCount += minVal;
        }
        
        int maxOpsRemoved = 0;
        for (auto query : queries) {
            int opsRemoved = min(opsCount, query[1] - query[0] + 1);
            maxOpsRemoved = max(maxOpsRemoved, opsRemoved);
        }
        
        return opsCount - maxOpsRemoved;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        opsCount = 0
        
        for query in queries:
            minVal = float('inf')
            for i in range(query[0], query[1]+1):
                minVal = min(minVal, nums[i])
            opsCount += minVal
        
        maxOpsRemoved = 0
        for query in queries:
            opsRemoved = min(opsCount, query[1] - query[0] + 1)
            maxOpsRemoved = max(maxOpsRemoved, opsRemoved)
        
        return opsCount - maxOpsRemoved
