### Explanation:
To find the smallest number with all set bits greater than or equal to a given number `n`, we can follow these steps:
1. Find the most significant bit position of `n` with a set bit.
2. Create a mask with all bits set from the most significant bit position to the least significant bit position.
3. Increment this mask to get the smallest number that satisfies the condition.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestNumberWithAllSetBits(int n) {
        int msb = 0;
        while ((1 << msb) <= n) {
            msb++;
        }
        return (1 << msb) - 1;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestNumberWithAllSetBits(int n) {
        int msb = 0;
        while ((1 << msb) <= n) {
            msb++;
        }
        return (1 << msb) - 1;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestNumberWithAllSetBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        msb = 0
        while (1 << msb) <= n:
            msb += 1
        return (1 << msb) - 1
```
