## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each node in the first tree and each node in the second tree, calculating the maximum number of nodes that are target to the current node in the first tree after connecting it to a node in the second tree. We can achieve this by performing a depth-first search (DFS) from each node in both trees and keeping track of the count of nodes that are target to the current node.

1. Build adjacency lists for both trees using the provided edges.
2. Perform DFS from each node in both trees to calculate the count of nodes that are target to each node.
3. For each query (connecting a node from the first tree to a node in the second tree), update the counts of nodes that are target to the affected nodes accordingly.
4. Return the final counts after all queries.

Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n and m are the number of nodes in the two trees respectively.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) for storing adjacency lists and DFS stacks.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxNumOfSubstrings(String s) {
        // Java solution code here
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxNumOfSubstrings(string s) {
        // C++ solution code here
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        # Python solution code here
```
