## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each word in the `content_text` column, apply the capitalization rules as mentioned in the problem description, and then construct the `converted_text` accordingly. We can split the text into words using spaces as delimiters and then process each word individually based on the rules provided.

- Split the `content_text` into words.
- For each word:
  - If the word contains a hyphen, split it into parts and capitalize each part.
  - Otherwise, capitalize the first letter and convert the rest to lowercase.
- Reconstruct the `converted_text` by joining the processed words.
- Return the result table with `content_id`, `original_text`, and `converted_text`.

Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length of a word.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the converted text.
