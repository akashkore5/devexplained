## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of breaking the locks using a greedy approach. We iterate through the locks and keep track of the current energy of the sword and the factor x. We update the energy and factor accordingly to break each lock. The minimum time required will be the maximum energy required to break any lock.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize time = 0, energy = 0, x = 1.
2. Iterate through each lock:
   - Increment time by 1 for each lock.
   - Update energy and x based on the current lock's strength and k.
3. Return the total time taken to break all locks.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of locks.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToBreakLocks(int[] strength, int k) {
        int time = 0;
        int energy = 0;
        int x = 1;

        for (int s : strength) {
            time++;
            energy = Math.max(energy, s - energy);
            x += k;
        }

        return time;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToBreakLocks(vector<int>& strength, int k) {
        int time = 0;
        int energy = 0;
        int x = 1;

        for (int s : strength) {
            time++;
            energy = max(energy, s - energy);
            x += k;
        }

        return time;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minTimeToBreakLocks(self, strength: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        time = 0
        energy = 0
        x = 1

        for s in strength:
            time += 1
            energy = max(energy, s - energy)
            x += k

        return time
```
