### Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the team dominance by pass success for each team in a competition. Team dominance by pass success is defined as the number of other teams that a team has a higher pass success rate than.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each team and calculate their pass success rate by comparing it with all other teams. For each team, we compare its pass success rate with all other teams and increment the count if the pass success rate of the current team is greater than the pass success rate of the other team.

### Algorithm:

1. Create a result array to store the team dominance by pass success for each team.
2. Iterate through each team in the input array.
3. For each team, iterate through all other teams in the input array.
4. Calculate the pass success rate for the current team and the other team.
5. If the pass success rate of the current team is greater than the pass success rate of the other team, increment the count for team dominance by pass success.
6. Store the count in the result array for the current team.
7. Return the result array.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of teams in the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the result array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] teamDominance(int[][] passSuccess) {
        int n = passSuccess.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    double team1SuccessRate = ((double) passSuccess[i][0] / passSuccess[i][1]);
                    double team2SuccessRate = ((double) passSuccess[j][0] / passSuccess[j][1]);
                    
                    if (team1SuccessRate > team2SuccessRate) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            result[i] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> teamDominance(vector<vector<int>>& passSuccess) {
        int n = passSuccess.size();
        vector<int> result(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    double team1SuccessRate = (double) passSuccess[i][0] / passSuccess[i][1];
                    double team2SuccessRate = (double) passSuccess[j][0] / passSuccess[j][1];
                    
                    if (team1SuccessRate > team2SuccessRate) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            result[i] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def teamDominance(self, passSuccess: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(passSuccess)
        result = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            count = 0
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j:
                    team1_success_rate = passSuccess[i][0] / passSuccess[i][1]
                    team2_success_rate = passSuccess[j][0] / passSuccess[j][1]
                    
                    if team1_success_rate > team2_success_rate:
                        count += 1
            result[i] = count
        
        return result
