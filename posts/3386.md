## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the events array and calculate the time taken to press each button by finding the difference in time between consecutive button presses. We keep track of the longest time taken and the corresponding button index. If multiple buttons have the same longest time, we return the button with the smallest index.

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the longest time, the button index with the longest time, and the previous time.
2. Iterate through the events array.
3. For each event, calculate the time taken to press the button by finding the difference between the current time and the previous time.
4. Update the longest time and button index if the current button press took longer than the previous longest time.
5. If multiple buttons have the same longest time, return the button with the smallest index.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of events in the input.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int buttonWithLongestPushTime(int[][] events) {
        int longestTime = 0;
        int longestButton = -1;
        int prevTime = events[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < events.length; i++) {
            int currentTime = events[i][1];
            int timeTaken = currentTime - prevTime;
            if (timeTaken > longestTime) {
                longestTime = timeTaken;
                longestButton = events[i][0];
            }
            prevTime = currentTime;
        }
        
        return longestButton;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int buttonWithLongestPushTime(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        int longestTime = 0;
        int longestButton = -1;
        int prevTime = events[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < events.size(); i++) {
            int currentTime = events[i][1];
            int timeTaken = currentTime - prevTime;
            if (timeTaken > longestTime) {
                longestTime = timeTaken;
                longestButton = events[i][0];
            }
            prevTime = currentTime;
        }
        
        return longestButton;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def buttonWithLongestPushTime(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        longestTime = 0
        longestButton = -1
        prevTime = events[0][1]
        
        for i in range(1, len(events)):
            currentTime = events[i][1]
            timeTaken = currentTime - prevTime
            if timeTaken > longestTime:
                longestTime = timeTaken
                longestButton = events[i][0]
            prevTime = currentTime
        
        return longestButton
```
