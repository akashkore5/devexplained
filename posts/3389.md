### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string `s` and count the frequency of each character. Then, we find the most frequent character and calculate the total number of operations required to make all characters occur the same number of times as the most frequent character. The operations can be either deletion, insertion, or changing a character to its next letter in the alphabet.

1. Count the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
2. Find the most frequent character.
3. Calculate the total number of operations required to make all characters occur the same number of times as the most frequent character.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array to count the frequencies of characters.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (int f : freq) {
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, f);
        }
        
        int operations = 0;
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f > 0 && f < maxFreq) {
                operations += f;
            } else if (f > maxFreq) {
                operations += f - maxFreq;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (int f : freq) {
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, f);
        }
        
        int operations = 0;
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f > 0 && f < maxFreq) {
                operations += f;
            } else if (f > maxFreq) {
                operations += f - maxFreq;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        maxFreq = max(freq)
        
        operations = 0
        for f in freq:
            if f > 0 and f < maxFreq:
                operations += f
            elif f > maxFreq:
                operations += f - maxFreq
        
        return operations
```
