### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each player in the team and maintain a map that stores the last pass time for each player. As we iterate through the passes, we update the last pass time for each player and calculate the current pass streak length. We keep track of the maximum pass streak length encountered so far and update it if a longer streak is found. 

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Initialize a map to store the last pass time for each player.
2. Initialize variables `maxStreak` to store the maximum pass streak length encountered so far and `currentStreak` to store the current pass streak length.
3. Iterate through each pass:
   - Check if the player is already in the map. If not, add the player to the map with the current pass time.
   - If the player is already in the map, calculate the current pass streak length as the difference between the current pass time and the last pass time for that player.
   - Update the last pass time for the player in the map.
   - Update the `currentStreak` by incrementing it or resetting it to 1 if the streak is broken.
   - Update `maxStreak` if the `currentStreak` is greater than `maxStreak`.
4. Return the `maxStreak` as the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of passes in the input.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of unique players in the team.
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestTeamPassStreak(int[][] passes) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> lastPassTime = new HashMap<>();
        int maxStreak = 0;
        int currentStreak = 0;
        
        for (int[] pass : passes) {
            int player = pass[0];
            int passTime = pass[1];
            
            if (!lastPassTime.containsKey(player)) {
                lastPassTime.put(player, passTime);
            } else {
                int lastTime = lastPassTime.get(player);
                int streak = passTime - lastTime;
                lastPassTime.put(player, passTime);
                
                currentStreak = (streak == 1) ? currentStreak + 1 : 1;
                maxStreak = Math.max(maxStreak, currentStreak);
            }
        }
        
        return maxStreak;
    }
}

            int passTime = pass[1];
            
            if (lastPassTime.find(player) == lastPassTime.end()) {
                lastPassTime[player] = passTime;
