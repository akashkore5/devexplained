## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and maintain a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. For each element, if it is already in the set, we increment our operations count by 1. If it is not in the set, we add it to the set. Whenever the size of the set reaches 3, we clear the set and increment the operations count by 1.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N) where N is the number of elements in the input array. The space complexity is O(1) since the set will contain at most 3 elements.
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int operations = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (set.contains(num)) {
                operations++;
            } else {
                set.add(num);
            }

            if (set.size() == 3) {
                set.clear();
                operations++;
            }
        }

        return operations;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_set<int> set;
        int operations = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (set.find(num) != set.end()) {
                operations++;
            } else {
                set.insert(num);
            }

            if (set.size() == 3) {
                set.clear();
                operations++;
            }
        }

        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        distinct_set = set()
        operations = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num in distinct_set:
                operations += 1
            else:
                distinct_set.add(num)

            if len(distinct_set) == 3:
                distinct_set.clear()
                operations += 1

        return operations
```
