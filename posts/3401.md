### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a graph-based approach where each person is represented as a node in the graph, and the gift exchange relationships are represented as directed edges between the nodes. Then, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each node to find circular gift exchange chains.

Here are the steps:
1. Build a directed graph where each node represents a person and each directed edge represents a gift exchange relationship.
2. Perform a DFS starting from each node to find circular gift exchange chains.
3. During the DFS, keep track of the visited nodes and the current path to detect cycles.
4. If a cycle is detected during the DFS, add the nodes in the cycle to the result.

Time complexity: O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes (people) and E is the number of edges (gift exchange relationships).
Space complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes (people) for storing the graph and visited nodes.
