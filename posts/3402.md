### Explanation

To make all columns of the grid strictly increasing, we need to determine the minimum number of operations needed for each column individually. For each column `j`, we need to calculate the total number of operations required to make all values in that column strictly increasing. This can be done by iterating through the column from top to bottom and adjusting each value as necessary.

The algorithm involves calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent values in a column and determining the number of operations required to make the values strictly increasing. The total number of operations needed for a column is the sum of operations required for each pair of adjacent values.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int totalOps = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
                if (grid[i][j] <= grid[i-1][j]) {
                    totalOps += grid[i-1][j] - grid[i][j] + 1;
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j] + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return totalOps;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int totalOps = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
                if (grid[i][j] <= grid[i-1][j]) {
                    totalOps += grid[i-1][j] - grid[i][j] + 1;
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j] + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return totalOps;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        total_ops = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            for i in range(1, m):
                if grid[i][j] <= grid[i-1][j]:
                    total_ops += grid[i-1][j] - grid[i][j] + 1
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j] + 1
        
        return total_ops
```
