### Explanation:
To find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished, we need to split the given word into non-empty strings in each round. We should aim to choose the maximum character lexicographically in each round to get the final lexicographically largest string.

1. We can start by sorting the characters of the given word in decreasing order.
2. Initialize a counter for each character to keep track of how many times it has been used.
3. Iterate through the sorted characters and select the character with the maximum count available.
4. Decrement the count of the selected character and append it to the final result.
5. Repeat this process for the required number of friends.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public String splitWord(String word, int numFriends) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < numFriends; i++) {
            for (int j = 25; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (count[j] > 0) {
                    result.append((char) (j + 'a'));
                    count[j]--;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string splitWord(string word, int numFriends) {
        vector<int> count(26, 0);
        for (char c : word) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }

        string result;
        for (int i = 0; i < numFriends; i++) {
            for (int j = 25; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (count[j] > 0) {
                    result += (char)(j + 'a');
                    count[j]--;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def splitWord(self, word: str, numFriends: int) -> str:
        count = [0] * 26
        for c in word:
            count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        result = ''
        for _ in range(numFriends):
            for j in range(25, -1, -1):
                if count[j] > 0:
                    result += chr(j + ord('a'))
                    count[j] -= 1
                    break
        
        return result
```
