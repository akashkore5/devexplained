### Explanation
To solve this problem without using loops/recursion, we can use two key observations:
1. Any power of four must be a power of two as well.
2. Any power of two in binary form has only one bit set to 1.

Based on these observations, we can create a mask where the only bit set to 1 is in an even position (starting from 0). By bitwise ANDing this mask with the given number, we can check if it is a power of four.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0 && (n & 0x55555555) != 0;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0 && (n & 0x55555555) != 0;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0 and (n & 0x55555555) != 0
```
