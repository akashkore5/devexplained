### Explanation:
To find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in a circular array, we can iterate through the array and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements. We need to consider the circular nature of the array, so we also calculate the absolute difference between the last and first elements in the array. The maximum of these differences will be our answer.

1. Initialize a variable `maxDiff` to store the maximum absolute difference.
2. Iterate through the array and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements.
3. Calculate the absolute difference between the last and first elements.
4. Update `maxDiff` with the maximum of all these differences.
5. Return `maxDiff` as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDiff(int[] nums) {
        int maxDiff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));
        }
        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0]));
        return maxDiff;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDiff(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxDiff = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            maxDiff = max(maxDiff, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));
        }
        maxDiff = max(maxDiff, abs(nums[nums.size() - 1] - nums[0]));
        return maxDiff;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDiff(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxDiff = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            maxDiff = max(maxDiff, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))
        maxDiff = max(maxDiff, abs(nums[-1] - nums[0]))
        return maxDiff
```
