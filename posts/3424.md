### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the arrays `arr` and `brr` simultaneously and for each element in `arr`, we calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in `arr` and `brr`. We then add this difference to a priority queue and remove the largest `k` elements from the priority queue, as we only need to minimize the total cost.

The priority queue helps us keep track of the largest differences, and by removing the largest `k` elements, we ensure that we minimize the total cost. Finally, we return the sum of the remaining elements in the priority queue as the minimum total cost.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) where n is the length of the arrays `arr` and `brr`.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the arrays `arr` and `brr`.

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] arr, int[] brr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pq.offer(Math.abs(arr[i] - brr[i]));
        }

        while (k > 0) {
            pq.poll();
            k--;
        }

        int totalCost = 0;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            totalCost += pq.poll();
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(std::vector<int>& arr, std::vector<int>& brr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        std::priority_queue<int> pq;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pq.push(std::abs(arr[i] - brr[i]));
        }

        while (k > 0) {
            pq.pop();
            k--;
        }

        int totalCost = 0;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            totalCost += pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minCost(self, arr: List[int], brr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        pq = []

        for i in range(n):
            heapq.heappush(pq, -(abs(arr[i] - brr[i])))

        while k > 0:
            heapq.heappop(pq)
            k -= 1

        total_cost = 0
        while pq:
            total_cost += -heapq.heappop(pq)

        return total_cost
```
