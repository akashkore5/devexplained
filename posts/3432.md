## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the running prefix sum. At each index, we can calculate the sum of elements on the left of that index and the sum of elements on the right of that index. The difference between these two sums will determine if the partition has an even sum difference. We can count the number of such partitions.

- Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of partitions with even sum difference.
- Iterate through the array and calculate the prefix sum.
- For each index `i`, calculate the sum of elements on the left and right of that index.
- Check if the difference between the left sum and right sum is even. If it is, increment the `count`.
- Return the `count` as the final result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
```java
public int countPartitionsWithEvenSumDifference(int[] nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        int leftSum = 0;
        int rightSum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            leftSum += nums[j];
        }
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            rightSum += nums[j];
        }
        if ((leftSum - rightSum) % 2 == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

```cpp
int countPartitionsWithEvenSumDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
        int leftSum = 0;
        int rightSum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            leftSum += nums[j];
        }
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            rightSum += nums[j];
        }
        if ((leftSum - rightSum) % 2 == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

```python
def countPartitionsWithEvenSumDifference(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        left_sum = sum(nums[:i + 1])
        right_sum = sum(nums[i + 1:])
        if (left_sum - right_sum) % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```
