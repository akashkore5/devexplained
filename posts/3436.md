### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use SQL query to filter out the valid email addresses based on the given criteria. We can use the `LIKE` operator and string manipulation functions to extract the required information from the email column.

:

#### SQL:
```sql
SELECT user_id, email
FROM Users
WHERE email LIKE '%@%._%.com'
AND email NOT LIKE '%_@%'
ORDER BY user_id;
