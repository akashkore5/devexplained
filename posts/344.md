### Explanation
To reverse a string in-place, we can use two pointers approach. We start with one pointer at the beginning of the array and another pointer at the end of the array. We swap the characters at these two positions and move the pointers towards the center until they meet. This way, we reverse the string in-place without using any extra memory.  

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```
