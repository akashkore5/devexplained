### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all substrings of length at least `k` and keep track of the frequencies of characters within each substring. For each substring, we calculate the difference between the frequency of the character with odd frequency and the frequency of the character with even frequency. We update the maximum difference found so far. Finally, we return the maximum difference.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `maxDiff` to store the maximum difference found so far.
2. Iterate through all substrings of length at least `k` in the input string `s`.
3. For each substring, calculate the frequencies of all characters.
4. Find the character with odd frequency and the character with even frequency in the substring and calculate the difference in their frequencies.
5. Update `maxDiff` if the calculated difference is greater than the current `maxDiff`.
6. Return the final `maxDiff` as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(N^2) where N is the length of the input string `s`.
**Space Complexity:** O(N) for storing frequencies of characters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDiff(String s, int k) {
        int maxDiff = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++) {
            int[] freq = new int[5];
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
                freq[s.charAt(j) - '0']++;
            }
            for (int a = 0; a <= 4; a++) {
                for (int b = 0; b <= 4; b++) {
                    if (freq[a] > 0 && freq[b] > 0 && freq[a] % 2 == 1 && freq[b] % 2 == 0) {
                        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, freq[a] - freq[b]);
                    }
                }
