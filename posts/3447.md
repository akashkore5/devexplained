## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we iterate over each group and each element, checking if the group size is divisible by the element. If it is divisible, we assign the element to that group. We keep track of the assigned elements and return the results in the assigned array.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an array `assigned` of size equal to the number of groups, filled with -1.
2. For each group, iterate through each element. If the group size is divisible by the current element and the group is not already assigned, assign the current element to that group.
3. Continue this process for all groups and elements.
4. Return the `assigned` array as the final result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where n is the number of groups and m is the number of elements.

**Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of groups.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] assignElements(int[] groups, int[] elements) {
        int n = groups.length;
        int m = elements.length;
        int[] assigned = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(assigned, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (groups[i] % elements[j] == 0 && assigned[i] == -1) {
                    assigned[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        return assigned;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> assignElements(vector<int>& groups, vector<int>& elements) {
        int n = groups.size();
        int m = elements.size();
        vector<int> assigned(n, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (groups[i] % elements[j] == 0 && assigned[i] == -1) {
                    assigned[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        return assigned;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def assignElements(self, groups: List[int], elements: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(groups)
        m = len(elements)
        assigned = [-1] * n

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if groups[i] % elements[j] == 0 and assigned[i] == -1:
                    assigned[i] = j

        return assigned
```
