## Explanation

To maximize the minimum game score, we need to find the optimal strategy for making at most `m` moves to either increase or decrease the index by 1 at each step. The idea is to use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum value in the game score. We can simulate the process of choosing the minimum value for the game score and check if it is possible to achieve that score within `m` moves.

1. Define a helper function to check if a given minimum value can be achieved within `m` moves.
2. Use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum value that can be achieved.
3. While performing the binary search, simulate the process of choosing the minimum value and check if it is possible within `m` moves.

Time complexity: O(n * log(max_score) * log(n))
Space complexity: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maximizeGameScore(int[] points, int m) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = (int)1e9;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canAchieveScore(points, m, mid)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left - 1;
    }
    
    private boolean canAchieveScore(int[] points, int m, int minScore) {
        int n = points.length;
        int moves = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += points[i];
            if (sum >= minScore) {
                sum = 0;
                moves++;
            }
        }
        
        return moves >= m;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeGameScore(vector<int>& points, int m) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = 1e9;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canAchieveScore(points, m, mid)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left - 1;
    }
    
    bool canAchieveScore(vector<int>& points, int m, int minScore) {
        int n = points.size();
        int moves = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += points[i];
            if (sum >= minScore) {
                sum = 0;
                moves++;
            }
        }
        
        return moves >= m;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeGameScore(self, points: List[int], m: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, 10**9
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if self.canAchieveScore(points, m, mid):
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        return left - 1
    
    def canAchieveScore(self, points: List[int], m: int, minScore: int) -> bool:
        n = len(points)
        moves = 0
        total = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            total += points[i]
            if total >= minScore:
                total = 0
                moves += 1
        
        return moves >= m
