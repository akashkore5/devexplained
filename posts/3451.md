### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each IP address in the logs table and check if it is a valid IPv4 address according to the given conditions. We can do this by splitting the IP address into octets, checking each octet for validity, and then counting the invalid IP addresses.

1. Split the IP address into octets.
2. Validate each octet based on the given conditions.
3. Count the number of invalid IP addresses and store them in a map.
4. Sort the map by the number of invalid IP addresses and then by IP address in descending order.

Time Complexity: O(n * k), where n is the number of IP addresses in the logs table and k is the number of octets in each IP address.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of unique invalid IP addresses in the logs table.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
# Assume that the logs table is represented as a list of String arrays where each array contains log_id, ip, and status_code
# Return a list of String arrays where each array contains ip and invalid_count
```

```cpp
// Write your C++ solution here
// Assume that the logs table is represented as a vector of pairs where each pair contains ip and status_code
// Return a vector of pairs where each pair contains ip and invalid_count
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
# Assume that the logs table is represented as a list of tuples where each tuple contains ip and status_code
# Return a list of tuples where each tuple contains ip and invalid_count
```
