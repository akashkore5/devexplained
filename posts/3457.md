## Explanation
To maximize the total weight gained by eating pizzas, we can sort the pizzas in descending order. Then, we can pair up pizzas (W, X, Y, Z) such that we choose the heaviest pizza as Z and the second heaviest as Y on odd days, and the third heaviest as Y and the fourth heaviest as Z on even days. By following this strategy, we can ensure that we gain the maximum weight possible on each day.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to sorting the pizzas.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted array of pizzas.
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxPizzaWeight(int[] pizzas) {
        Arrays.sort(pizzas);
        int n = pizzas.length;
        int totalWeight = 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= n / 2; i -= 2) {
            totalWeight += pizzas[i];
        }
        
        return totalWeight;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPizzaWeight(std::vector<int>& pizzas) {
        std::sort(pizzas.begin(), pizzas.end());
        int n = pizzas.size();
        int totalWeight = 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= n / 2; i -= 2) {
            totalWeight += pizzas[i];
        }
        
        return totalWeight;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def max_pizza_weight(self, pizzas: List[int]) -> int:
        pizzas.sort()
        n = len(pizzas)
        total_weight = 0
        
        for i in range(n-1, n//2 - 1, -2):
            total_weight += pizzas[i]
        
        return total_weight
```
