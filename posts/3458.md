### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We iterate over the string `s` character by character. For each character, we keep track of the special substrings we have found and the characters that have been used in those substrings. If we encounter a character that is not used in any special substring, we can create a new special substring with that character. If we encounter a character that is used in a special substring, we move on to the next character. We continue this process until we have found `k` disjoint special substrings or until we reach the end of the string.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the characters used in the special substrings.

```java
public boolean canChoose(String s, int k) {
    boolean[] used = new boolean[26];
    int count = 0;

    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (!used[c - 'a']) {
            used[c - 'a'] = true;
            count++;
            if (count == k) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>

bool canChoose(string s, int k) {
    vector<bool> used(26, false);
    int count = 0;

    for (char c : s) {
        if (!used[c - 'a']) {
            used[c - 'a'] = true;
            count++;
            if (count == k) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

#### Python
```python
def can_choose(s: str, k: int) -> bool:
    used = [False] * 26
    count = 0

    for c in s:
        if not used[ord(c) - ord('a')]:
            used[ord(c) - ord('a')] = True
            count += 1
            if count == k:
                return True

    return False
```
