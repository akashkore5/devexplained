### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a queue to store the incoming data values. We will maintain a running sum of the elements currently in the queue to calculate the moving average efficiently. When a new element comes in, we add it to the queue and update the running sum. If the queue size exceeds the specified window size, we remove the oldest element from the queue and update the running sum accordingly.

#### Time Complexity
- The time complexity for adding a new element and calculating the moving average is O(1) since we are only performing constant time operations for each element.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) where n is the specified window size, as we are storing at most n elements in the queue at any given time.
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class MovingAverage {
    private Queue<Integer> queue;
    private int size;
    private double sum;

    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        this.queue = new LinkedList<>();
        this.size = size;
        this.sum = 0.0;
    }

    public double next(int val) {
        if (queue.size() == size) {
            sum -= queue.poll();
        }
        queue.offer(val);
        sum += val;
        return sum / queue.size();
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <queue>

class MovingAverage {
private:
    std::queue<int> q;
    int size;
    double sum;

public:
    MovingAverage(int size) {
        this->size = size;
        this->sum = 0.0;
    }

    double next(int val) {
        if (q.size() == size) {
            sum -= q.front();
            q.pop();
        }
        q.push(val);
        sum += val;
        return sum / q.size();
    }
};
```

```python
from collections import deque

class MovingAverage:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.queue = deque()
        self.size = size
        self.sum = 0.0

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        if len(self.queue) == self.size:
            self.sum -= self.queue.popleft()
        self.queue.append(val)
        self.sum += val
        return self.sum / len(self.queue)
```
