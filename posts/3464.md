## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between k selected points on the boundary of a square. We can approach this problem using binary search on the possible Manhattan distances. For a given Manhattan distance `d`, we can check if it is possible to select `k` points such that the minimum Manhattan distance among those points is at least `d`.

1. We start by defining the search space for the binary search. The minimum Manhattan distance can be 0 (when all points coincide) and the maximum Manhattan distance can be the diagonal length of the square, which is `side * sqrt(2)`.
2. In each iteration of the binary search, we calculate the mid point `mid` of the current search space and check if it is possible to select `k` points such that the minimum Manhattan distance is at least `mid`.
3. We can use backtracking to try all possible combinations of selecting `k` points and checking the minimum Manhattan distance.
4. If it is possible to select `k` points with minimum Manhattan distance `mid`, we update the lower bound of the search space to `mid`. Otherwise, we update the upper bound.
5. Repeat the process until the lower and upper bounds converge, and return the result.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N * 2^N) where N is the number of points on the boundary of the square.
```java
class Solution {
    public double maxMinDist(int side, int[][] points, int k) {
        // Implement binary search to find the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance
        // Code implementation here
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double maxMinDist(int side, vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        // Implement binary search to find the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance
        // Code implementation here
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxMinDist(self, side: int, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> float:
        # Implement binary search to find the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance
        # Code implementation here
```
