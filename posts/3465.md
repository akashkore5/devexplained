## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a regular expression pattern to match valid serial numbers within the description of each product. We will iterate through each product's description and check if it contains a valid serial number pattern. If a valid serial number is found, we include that product in the result table.

- We will use the regular expression `SN\d{4}-\d{4}` to match the valid serial number pattern.
- Iterate through each product's description.
- If a valid serial number is found, add the product to the result table.
- Order the result table by product_id in ascending order.

Time complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of products and m is the average length of descriptions.
Space complexity: O(1) excluding the space required for the result table.
