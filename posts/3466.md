## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a 2D array to keep track of the maximum coins collected up to a certain point in the grid. The idea is to start from the top-left corner of the grid and iterate through each cell. At each cell, we calculate the maximum coins that can be collected by considering the maximum coins collected from the top and left cells, and add the current cell's value to it.

Let's define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum coins collected up to cell `(i, j)`. We can then update this array iteratively by considering the maximum coins from the top and left cells.

The time complexity of this approach is O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. The space complexity is also O(m*n) for the 2D array to store the maximum coins.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]
        
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j]
        
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
