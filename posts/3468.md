## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given original array and bounds array simultaneously. For each index `i`, we calculate the minimum and maximum possible values that can be copied at that index `i` based on the bounds. Then, we update these minimum and maximum values as we move along the array.

We can maintain a counter to keep track of the number of valid arrays that satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to 1 (initially considering the original array itself as a valid copy).
2. Iterate over the arrays using a loop from index 1 to n-1:
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum values that can be copied at the current index based on the bounds.
   - Update the counter `count` by multiplying it with the number of valid values that can be copied at the current index.
3. Return the final value of the counter `count`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the original array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfArrays(int[] original, int[][] bounds) {
        long count = 1;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < original.length; i++) {
            int min = bounds[i][0];
            int max = bounds[i][1];
            
            count = (count * (Math.min(max, original[i]) - Math.max(min, original[i - 1]) + 1)) % mod;
            if (count == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return (int) count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfArrays(vector<int>& original, vector<vector<int>>& bounds) {
        long long count = 1;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < original.size(); i++) {
            int minVal = bounds[i][0];
            int maxVal = bounds[i][1];
            
            count = (count * (min(maxVal, original[i]) - max(minVal, original[i - 1]) + 1)) % mod;
            if (count == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return (int) count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numOfArrays(self, original: List[int], bounds: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 1
        mod = 1000000007
        
        for i in range(1, len(original)):
            min_val = bounds[i][0]
            max_val = bounds[i][1]
            
            count = (count * (min(max_val, original[i]) - max(min_val, original[i - 1]) + 1)) % mod
            if count == 0:
                break
        
        return int(count)
