### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We iterate through the array and maintain the minimum cost to remove elements up to that point. At each step, we consider the cost of removing the current element alone or along with the previous one or two elements, whichever is the minimum cost. We update the minimum cost accordingly. Finally, the minimum cost to remove all elements will be the value at the last index of our DP array.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a DP array of size n+1 to store the minimum cost to remove elements up to index i.
2. Iterate over the array from 0 to n-1.
3. For each index i, update the DP array with the minimum cost considering removing the current element alone or along with the previous one or two elements.
4. Return the value at the last index of the DP array as the minimum cost.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the DP array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(nums[i-1], Math.min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]));
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n+1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = min(nums[i-1], min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]));
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[1] = nums[0]
        
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = min(nums[i-1], min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]))
        
        return dp[n]
```
