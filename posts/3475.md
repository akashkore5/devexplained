### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iterate over each DNA sequence in the Samples table and check for the given patterns:
1. Starting with "ATG"
2. Ending with "TAA", "TAG", or "TGA"
3. Containing the motif "ATAT"
4. Having at least 3 consecutive "G"s

We can iterate over each character in the DNA sequence and check for each pattern. We will maintain flags for each pattern and update them accordingly. Finally, we will output the result table in the specified format.

- Time Complexity: O(N*M) where N is the number of DNA sequences and M is the length of each sequence.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
