### Explanation:
To maximize the profit from task assignment, we can first sort the tasks and then assign the tasks to the workers with the highest and lowest efficiency alternatively. This way, we can ensure that the total profit is maximized by choosing the most efficient worker for each task.

1. Sort the tasks based on their difficulty.
2. Sort the workers based on their efficiency.
3. Iterate over the sorted tasks and assign each task to the worker with the highest efficiency available.
4. Calculate the total profit as the sum of the products of task difficulties and worker efficiencies.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of tasks or workers.
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the sorted tasks or workers.

:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxProfitAssignment(int[] difficulty, int[] profit, int[] worker) {
        int n = difficulty.length;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        int[][] tasks = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tasks[i][0] = difficulty[i];
            tasks[i][1] = profit[i];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(tasks, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        Arrays.sort(worker);
        
        int i = 0, best = 0;
        for (int w : worker) {
            while (i < n && tasks[i][0] <= w) {
                best = Math.max(best, tasks[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            maxProfit += best;
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(std::vector<int>& difficulty, std::vector<int>& profit, std::vector<int>& worker) {
        int n = difficulty.size();
        int maxProfit = 0;
        
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> tasks(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tasks[i] = {difficulty[i], profit[i]};
        }
        
        std::sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end());
        std::sort(worker.begin(), worker.end());
        
        int i = 0, best = 0;
        for (int w : worker) {
            while (i < n && tasks[i].first <= w) {
                best = std::max(best, tasks[i].second);
                i++;
            }
            maxProfit += best;
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfitAssignment(self, difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int], worker: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(difficulty)
        max_profit = 0
        
        tasks = sorted(zip(difficulty, profit))
        worker.sort()
        
        i, best = 0, 0
        for w in worker:
            while i < n and tasks[i][0] <= w:
                best = max(best, tasks[i][1])
                i += 1
            max_profit += best
        
        return max_profit
