## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the organizational hierarchy by determining the level of each employee, calculating the team size for each manager, and calculating the salary budget for each manager.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Build a map to store the hierarchy of employees and their direct reports.
2. Traverse the hierarchy to calculate the level of each employee starting from the CEO.
3. Traverse the hierarchy again to calculate the team size and salary budget for each manager.
4. Order the result by level in ascending order, then by budget in descending order, and finally by employee name in ascending order.

### Time Complexity:
- Building the hierarchy: O(N), where N is the number of employees.
- Calculating levels, team size, and budget: O(N).
- Sorting the result: O(N log N) due to sorting.
- Overall time complexity: O(N log N).

### Space Complexity:
- Storing the hierarchy: O(N).
- Storing the result: O(N).
- Overall space complexity: O(N).
