### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can calculate the total weight of containers that can be loaded onto the ship by dividing the maximum weight capacity by the weight of each container. We then determine the maximum number of containers that can fit on the cargo deck by dividing the total number of cells by the number of containers that can be loaded based on weight.

1. Calculate the total weight capacity by multiplying the number of cells by the weight limit per cell.
2. Calculate the maximum number of containers that can be loaded onto the ship by dividing the total weight capacity by the weight of each container.
3. Return the minimum of the maximum number of containers and the total number of cells on the deck.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxContainers(int n, int w, int maxWeight) {
        int totalWeight = n * n * w;
        int maxContainers = maxWeight / w;
        return Math.min(maxContainers, n * n);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxContainers(int n, int w, int maxWeight) {
        int totalWeight = n * n * w;
        int maxContainers = maxWeight / w;
        return min(maxContainers, n * n);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxContainers(self, n: int, w: int, maxWeight: int) -> int:
        total_weight = n * n * w
        max_containers = maxWeight // w
        return min(max_containers, n * n)
```
