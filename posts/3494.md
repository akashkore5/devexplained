## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of brewing potions by iterating through each wizard and each potion. We keep track of the time each wizard finishes working on a potion and update the start time for the next wizard accordingly. The key idea is to synchronize the timing so that each wizard starts working on a potion immediately after the previous wizard finishes.

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum time taken for each wizard to brew each potion.
2. Iterate through each wizard and potion, updating the time taken based on the skill and mana capacities.
3. Update the start time for each wizard based on the completion time of the previous wizard.
4. Return the time taken by the last wizard to complete all potions.

Time Complexity: O(n * m)  
Space Complexity: O(n * m)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minBrewTime(int[] skill, int[] mana) {
        int n = skill.length;
        int m = mana.length;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = skill[0] * mana[j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + skill[i] * mana[0];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + skill[i] * mana[j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1][m - 1];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minBrewTime(vector<int>& skill, vector<int>& mana) {
        int n = skill.size();
        int m = mana.size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = skill[0] * mana[j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + skill[i] * mana[0];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + skill[i] * mana[j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1][m - 1];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minBrewTime(self, skill: List[int], mana: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(skill)
        m = len(mana)
        
        dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
        
        for j in range(m):
            dp[0][j] = skill[0] * mana[j]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + skill[i] * mana[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + skill[i] * mana[j]
        
        return dp[n - 1][m - 1]
