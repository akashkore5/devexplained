### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can observe that the operation of selecting two integers a and b and replacing them with floor(a/4) and floor(b/4) is equivalent to dividing each integer in the array by 4. We need to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements of the array to zero for each query. We can do this by iterating through each query, calculating the sum of the elements in the range [l, r], and then finding the minimum number of operations needed to reduce this sum to zero by dividing by 4 iteratively.

- **Algorithm:**
    1. Iterate through each query and calculate the sum of elements in the range [l, r].
    2. Initialize a counter to count the number of operations required.
    3. While the sum is not zero, divide the sum by 4 and increment the counter for each division.
    4. Return the total sum of operations for all queries.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[][] queries) {
        int totalOperations = 0;
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; i++) {
                sum += i;
            }
            int operations = 0;
            while (sum > 0) {
                sum /= 4;
                operations++;
            }
            totalOperations += operations;
        }
        return totalOperations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int totalOperations = 0;
        for (auto& query : queries) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; i++) {
                sum += i;
            }
            int operations = 0;
            while (sum > 0) {
                sum /= 4;
                operations++;
            }
            totalOperations += operations;
        }
        return totalOperations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        totalOperations = 0
        for query in queries:
            total = sum(range(query[0], query[1] + 1))
            operations = 0
            while total > 0:
                total //= 4
                operations += 1
            totalOperations += operations
        return totalOperations
```
