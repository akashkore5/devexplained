## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the cost array from the end to the beginning. At each position, we calculate the minimum cost to reach that position by considering two possibilities:
1. Swapping with the person at the current position.
2. Not swapping with the person at the current position.

We maintain an array `answer` to store the minimum total cost to reach each position in the line.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array `answer` of size n, where n is the length of the cost array.
2. Set `answer[n-1] = cost[n-1]` as the cost to reach the last position is equal to the cost at that position.
3. Iterate from n-2 to 0:
   - Calculate `answer[i]` as the minimum of `cost[i]` and `answer[i+1]` (cost at current position and cost at next position).
4. Return the `answer` array as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the cost array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) for the `answer` array.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minCostToReachEveryPosition(int[] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        answer[n-1] = cost[n-1];
        
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            answer[i] = Math.min(cost[i], answer[i+1]);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> minCostToReachEveryPosition(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<int> answer(n);
        answer[n-1] = cost[n-1];
        
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            answer[i] = min(cost[i], answer[i+1]);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostToReachEveryPosition(self, cost: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(cost)
        answer = [0] * n
        answer[n-1] = cost[n-1]
        
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            answer[i] = min(cost[i], answer[i+1])
        
        return answer
```
