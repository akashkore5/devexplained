### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing. At each step, we compare the current element with the next element. If the next element is smaller than the current element, we increment the number of operations by the difference between the current element and the next element. We then update the next element to be the sum of the current and next elements.

We repeat this process until we have iterated through the entire array, and the final count of operations will be the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `operations` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. If the current element is greater than the next element, increment `operations` by the difference between the current and next elements. Update the next element to be the sum of the current and next elements.
4. Repeat step 3 for all elements in the array.
5. Return the final value of `operations`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                operations += nums[i - 1] - nums[i];
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                operations += nums[i - 1] - nums[i];
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        operations = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
                operations += nums[i - 1] - nums[i]
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1]
        return operations
```
