## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking to explore all possible patterns that satisfy the given conditions. We will maintain a visited array to keep track of the keys that have been visited during the traversal. We will also keep a 2D array to represent the valid jumps between keys. 

1. Initialize the 2D array to store the valid jumps between keys. For example, if `jump[i][j]` is true, it means we can jump from key `i` to key `j`.
2. Start from each key and try to find all valid patterns of length `m` to `n`.
3. For each key, mark it as visited, explore its neighbors that have not been visited yet, and continue the traversal.
4. Backtrack by unmarking the key as visited to explore other valid patterns.
5. Count the number of valid patterns found during the traversal.

Time complexity: O(9! * 2^9) as we have 9 choices for the first key and at most 9 steps to explore.
Space complexity: O(9) for the visited array and O(9 * 9) for the jump array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfPatterns(int m, int n) {
        int[][] jump = new int[10][10];
        jump[1][3] = jump[3][1] = 2;
        jump[4][6] = jump[6][4] = 5;
        jump[7][9] = jump[9][7] = 8;
        jump[1][7] = jump[7][1] = 4;
        jump[2][8] = jump[8][2] = 5;
        jump[3][9] = jump[9][3] = 6;
        jump[1][9] = jump[9][1] = jump[3][7] = jump[7][3] = 5;

        int[] res = {0};
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[10];
        for (int i = m; i <= n; i++) {
            dfs(1, i - 1, visited, jump, res);
            dfs(2, i - 1, visited, jump, res);
            res[0] *= 4; // Patterns starting from 2, 4, 6, 8 are symmetric
            dfs(5, i - 1, visited, jump, res);
        }
        return res[0];
    }

    private void dfs(int cur, int remain, boolean[] visited, int[][] jump, int[] res) {
        if (remain < 0) return;
        if (remain == 0) {
            res[0]++;
            return;
        }
        visited[cur] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (!visited[i] && (jump[cur][i] == 0 || visited[jump[cur][i]])) {
                dfs(i, remain - 1, visited, jump, res);
            }
        }
        visited[cur] = false;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfPatterns(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> jump(10, vector<int>(10, 0));
        jump[1][3] = jump[3][1] = 2;
        jump[4][6] = jump[6][4] = 5;
        jump[7][9] = jump[9][7] = 8;
        jump[1][7] = jump[7][1] = 4;
        jump[2][8] = jump[8][2] = 5;
        jump[3][9] = jump[9][3] = 6;
        jump[1][9] = jump[9][1] = jump[3][7] = jump[7][3] = 5;

        int res = 0;
        vector<bool> visited(10, false);
        for (int i = m; i <= n; i++) {
            dfs(1, i - 1, visited, jump, res);
            dfs(2, i - 1, visited, jump, res);
            res *= 4; // Patterns starting from 2, 4, 6, 8 are symmetric
            dfs(5, i - 1, visited, jump, res);
        }
        return res;
    }

    void dfs(int cur, int remain, vector<bool>& visited, vector<vector<int>>& jump, int& res) {
        if (remain < 0) return;
        if (remain == 0) {
            res++;
            return;
        }
        visited[cur] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (!visited[i] && (jump[cur][i] == 0 || visited[jump[cur][i]])) {
                dfs(i, remain - 1, visited, jump, res);
            }
        }
        visited[cur] = false;
    }
};
