## Explanation:

Given an array of integers, the task is to make all elements of the array positive by performing some operations. The operations allowed are either incrementing or decrementing an element by 1. The goal is to minimize the sum of absolute differences between the original array elements and the modified positive array elements.

To achieve this, we can follow the below steps:
1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Start from the first element and iterate through each element.
3. For each element, calculate the difference between the current element and the previous element.
4. If the difference is negative, increment the current element to make it positive.
5. Update the sum of absolute differences accordingly.

By following this approach, we can modify the array elements to make them positive while minimizing the sum of absolute differences.

Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of elements in the array due to sorting.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                operations += (nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1);
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                operations += (nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1);
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        operations = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                operations += (nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1)
                nums[i] = nums[i - 1] + 1
        return operations
```
