## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of steps it takes for each Person 1 and Person 2 to reach Person 3. We can find this by calculating the absolute difference between the positions of Person 1 and Person 3, and Person 2 and Person 3, and then dividing by 2 (since both Person 1 and Person 2 move towards Person 3 at the same speed).

After calculating the steps for both Person 1 and Person 2, we can compare the results to determine which person arrives first or if they arrive at the same time.

- Time complexity: O(1) as the algorithm is constant time.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findClosestPerson(int x, int y, int z) {
        int stepsX = Math.abs(x - z) / 2;
        int stepsY = Math.abs(y - z) / 2;
        
        if (stepsX < stepsY) {
            return 1;
        } else if (stepsX > stepsY) {
            return 2;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findClosestPerson(int x, int y, int z) {
        int stepsX = abs(x - z) / 2;
        int stepsY = abs(y - z) / 2;
        
        if (stepsX < stepsY) {
            return 1;
        } else if (stepsX > stepsY) {
            return 2;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosestPerson(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
        stepsX = abs(x - z) // 2
        stepsY = abs(y - z) // 2
        
        if stepsX < stepsY:
            return 1
        elif stepsX > stepsY:
            return 2
        else:
            return 0
```
