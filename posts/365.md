### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the "BÃ©zout's identity" theorem which states that for given non-negative integers a and b, there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = d (where d is the greatest common divisor of a and b). In this problem, if the target amount of water is reachable, it must be a multiple of the greatest common divisor of x and y. We can find this greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.

Here is how the algorithm works:
1. Check if the target amount is less than or equal to the sum of the jug capacities x and y. If not, return false as the target is unreachable.
2. Find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. Check if the target amount is divisible by the gcd. If yes, return true; otherwise, return false.

Time complexity: O(log(min(x, y)))
Space complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canMeasureWater(int x, int y, int target) {
        if (target > x + y) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return target == 0 || (target % gcd(x, y) == 0);
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int x, int y, int target) {
        if (target > x + y) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return target == 0 || (target % gcd(x, y) == 0);
    }
    
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, target: int) -> bool:
        if target > x + y:
            return False
        
        return target == 0 or target % self.gcd(x, y) == 0
    
    def gcd(self, a, b):
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
