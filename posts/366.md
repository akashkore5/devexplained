## Explanation

To find leaves of a binary tree, we can repeatedly remove the leaves until the tree becomes empty. At each step, we identify and remove all the leaves (nodes with no children) from the tree and store them in a separate list. We repeat this process until there are no more leaves left in the tree.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a function `findLeaves` that takes the root of the binary tree as input.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the leaves.
3. Repeat the following steps until the tree becomes empty:
   - Create a helper function `dfs` that returns the height of the current node.
   - If the current node is a leaf (i.e., both left and right children are null), add it to the list of leaves and return 0.
   - Otherwise, calculate the height of the current node as 1 + max(height of left child, height of right child).
4. Remove the leaves that were identified in each iteration from the tree.
5. Continue this process until all leaves are removed from the tree.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        while (root != null) {
            List<Integer> leaves = new ArrayList<>();
            root = removeLeaves(root, leaves);
            result.add(leaves);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private TreeNode removeLeaves(TreeNode node, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            leaves.add(node.val);
            return null;
        }
        node.left = removeLeaves(node.left, leaves);
        node.right = removeLeaves(node.right, leaves);
        return node;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        while (root) {
            vector<int> leaves;
            root = removeLeaves(root, leaves);
            result.push_back(leaves);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    TreeNode* removeLeaves(TreeNode* node, vector<int>& leaves) {
        if (!node) return NULL;
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            leaves.push_back(node->val);
            return NULL;
        }
        node->left = removeLeaves(node->left, leaves);
        node->right = removeLeaves(node->right, leaves);
        return node;
    }
};
```

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def findLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        while root:
            leaves = []
            root = self.removeLeaves(root, leaves)
            result.append(leaves)
        return result
    
    def removeLeaves(self, node, leaves):
        if not node:
            return None
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            leaves.append(node.val)
            return None
        node.left = self.removeLeaves(node.left, leaves)
        node.right = self.removeLeaves(node.right, leaves)
        return node
