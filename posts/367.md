### Explanation
To determine if a given number is a perfect square, we can use a binary search approach. We start by setting the left boundary to 1 and the right boundary to the given number `num`. We then repeatedly divide the search space in half by choosing a mid value. We square the mid value and compare it with the input number `num` to decide whether to move the right boundary to the left half or the left boundary to the right half. We continue this process until the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary. If at any point we find the square of the mid value to be equal to the input number, we return true as it is a perfect square. If we exhaust the search space and do not find a perfect square, we return false.

- Time complexity: O(log(num))
- Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long left = 1, right = num;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long square = mid * mid;
            if (square == num) {
                return true;
            } else if (square < num) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        long left = 1, right = num;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long square = mid * mid;
            if (square == num) {
                return true;
            } else if (square < num) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:
        left, right = 1, num
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            square = mid * mid
            if square == num:
                return True
            elif square < num:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return False
```
