## Explanation:
To find the sum of two integers without using the `+` and `-` operators, we can utilize bitwise operations. The idea is to perform addition using bitwise XOR and carry using bitwise AND left-shift.

Here's how the algorithm works:
1. Initialize two variables `sum` and `carry`.
2. Calculate the sum of `a` and `b` without considering the carry by performing XOR operation: `sum = a ^ b`.
3. Calculate the carry by performing AND operation on `a` and `b`, then left-shifting it by 1: `carry = (a & b) << 1`.
4. Update `a` with the new `sum` and `b` with the new `carry`.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until there is no carry left.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as the number of iterations is limited by the number of bits in the input integers. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int sum = a ^ b;
            int carry = (a & b) << 1;
            a = sum;
            b = carry;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int sum = a ^ b;
            int carry = (a & b) << 1;
            a = sum;
            b = carry;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        while b != 0:
            sum = a ^ b
            carry = (a & b) << 1
            a = sum
            b = carry
        return a
```
