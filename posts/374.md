## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search algorithm. The idea is to iteratively guess the number in the middle of the range (1 to n) and adjust the search range based on the response from the `guess` function. If the guess is too high, we update the upper bound of the range. If the guess is too low, we update the lower bound of the range. We continue this process until we find the correct number.

- **Algorithm:**
  1. Initialize `low` as 1 and `high` as n.
  2. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, do the following:
     - Calculate the mid point as `(low + high) / 2`.
     - Make a guess using `guess(mid)`.
     - Update the search range based on the guess:
        - If the guess result is -1, set `high = mid - 1`.
        - If the guess result is 1, set `low = mid + 1`.
        - If the guess result is 0, return `mid`.

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) - Binary search reduces the search space by half in every iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant extra space is used.
```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int result = guess(mid);
            if (result == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (result == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Not found
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution : public GuessGame {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int result = guess(mid);
            if (result == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (result == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Not found
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        low = 1
        high = n
        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            result = guess(mid)
            if result == 0:
                return mid
            elif result == -1:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return -1  # Not found
```
