### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a function `dp(i, j)` which represents the minimum cost to guess a number between `i` and `j`. We need to find `dp(1, n)`.

The key observation is that for any `x` chosen as the guess, the maximum cost is `x + max(dp(i, x-1), dp(x+1, j))`. Therefore, we can iterate `x` from `i` to `j` and take the minimum of all such costs.

The final answer will be the minimum cost over all choices of `x`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this dynamic programming approach is O(n^3) where n is the given number.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n^2) for storing the DP table.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][n+1];
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int start = 1; start <= n - len + 1; start++) {
                int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int guess = start; guess < start + len - 1; guess++) {
                    int cost = guess + Math.max(dp[start][guess - 1], dp[guess + 1][start + len - 1]);
                    minCost = Math.min(minCost, cost);
                }
                dp[start][start + len - 1] = minCost;
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int start = 1; start <= n - len + 1; start++) {
                int minCost = INT_MAX;
                for (int guess = start; guess < start + len - 1; guess++) {
                    int cost = guess + max(dp[start][guess - 1], dp[guess + 1][start + len - 1]);
                    minCost = min(minCost, cost);
                }
                dp[start][start + len - 1] = minCost;
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def getMoneyAmount(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for start in range(1, n - length + 2):
                min_cost = float('inf')
                for guess in range(start, start + length - 1):
                    cost = guess + max(dp[start][guess - 1], dp[guess + 1][start + length - 1])
                    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
                dp[start][start + length - 1] = min_cost
        return dp[1][n]
```
