## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations that add up to `i`. We initialize `dp[0] = 1` since there is one way to get a sum of 0.

For each target sum `i` from 1 to the given `target`, we iterate through the input array `nums` to find all possible combinations that can achieve the sum `i`. We update `dp[i]` by adding the number of combinations found.

Finally, the result is stored in `dp[target]`, which represents the total number of combinations that add up to the target.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(target * nums.length) since we iterate through each target value and each element in the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(target) for the `dp` array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (i - num >= 0) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - num];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int combinationSum4(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (i - num >= 0) {
                    dp[i] += dp[i - num];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, target + 1):
            for num in nums:
                if i - num >= 0:
                    dp[i] += dp[i - num]
        
        return dp[target]
```
