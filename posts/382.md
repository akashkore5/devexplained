### Explanation
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the Reservoir Sampling algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the linked list while maintaining a selected node that will be updated with a certain probability at each step to ensure each node has an equal chance of being chosen.

- In the constructor, we initialize the selected node to the head of the linked list.
- For each subsequent node, we generate a random number to decide whether to update the selected node with the current node.
- This way, by the end of the iteration, the selected node will be one of the nodes from the linked list with equal probability.

The time complexity for getRandom() is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any extra space.

```java
import java.util.Random;

class Solution {
    ListNode head;
    Random random;

    public Solution(ListNode head) {
        this.head = head;
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public int getRandom() {
        ListNode current = head;
        ListNode selected = null;
        int index = 0;

        while (current != null) {
            if (random.nextInt(++index) == 0) {
                selected = current;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        return selected.val;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <random>

class Solution {
private:
    ListNode* head;
    std::default_random_engine generator;

public:
    Solution(ListNode* head) : head(head) {}

    int getRandom() {
        ListNode* current = head;
        ListNode* selected = nullptr;
        int index = 0;

        while (current != nullptr) {
            if (std::uniform_int_distribution<int>{0, index}(generator) == 0) {
                selected = current;
            }
            current = current->next;
            index++;
        }

        return selected->val;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
import random

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, head: ListNode):
        self.head = head

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        current = self.head
        selected = None
        index = 0

        while current:
            if random.randint(0, index) == 0:
                selected = current
            current = current.next
            index += 1

        return selected.val
```
