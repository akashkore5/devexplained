## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate over the characters in the `magazine` string and count the frequency of each character. Then, we iterate over the characters in the `ransomNote` string and decrement the corresponding character count from the `magazine` map. If at any point the count goes negative or the character is not present in the map, we return false. If we are able to successfully construct the `ransomNote` using the characters from `magazine`, we return true.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(m + n), where m is the length of the `magazine` string and n is the length of the `ransomNote` string.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) since the frequency map will at most contain 26 lowercase English letters.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        
        for (char c : magazine.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : ransomNote.toCharArray()) {
            if (count[c - 'a'] == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            count[c - 'a']--;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        vector<int> count(26, 0);
        
        for (char c : magazine) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : ransomNote) {
            if (count[c - 'a'] == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            count[c - 'a']--;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        count = [0] * 26
        
        for c in magazine:
            count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        for c in ransomNote:
            if count[ord(c) - ord('a')] == 0:
                return False
            count[ord(c) - ord('a')] -= 1
        
        return True
```
