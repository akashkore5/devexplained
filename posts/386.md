### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can leverage the lexicographical ordering of numbers. We can achieve the desired ordering by simulating a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a tree where each node represents a number. The idea is to explore the numbers in lexicographical order by repeatedly multiplying the current number by 10 and adding numbers from 0 to 9. We start from 1 and keep appending numbers until we reach n.

The key observations are:
1. When we move from a number x to x*10, the numbers in between are x*10, x*10+1, x*10+2, ..., x*10+9.
2. If x*10 <= n, we can explore the subtree rooted at x*10. If not, we need to backtrack to the parent node and increment it to x+1.

By following the above observations, we can generate the lexicographically sorted numbers from 1 to n efficiently.

**Time Complexity**:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we are exploring each number once.

**Space Complexity**:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space proportional to n.
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int current = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res.add(current);
            if (current * 10 <= n) {
                current *= 10;
            } else {
                if (current >= n) current /= 10;
                current += 1;
                while (current % 10 == 0) current /= 10;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        vector<int> res;
        int current = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            res.push_back(current);
            if (current * 10 <= n) {
                current *= 10;
            } else {
                if (current >= n) current /= 10;
                current += 1;
                while (current % 10 == 0) current /= 10;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lexicalOrder(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        current = 1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            res.append(current)
            if current * 10 <= n:
                current *= 10
            else:
                if current >= n: current //= 10
                current += 1
                while current % 10 == 0: current //= 10
        return res
```
