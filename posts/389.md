### Explanation
To find the added letter in string `t`, we can calculate the ASCII value sum of all characters in both strings `s` and `t`. The difference between these sums will give us the ASCII value of the added letter. We can then convert this ASCII value back to a character to get the added letter.

- Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
- Iterate over all characters in both strings `s` and `t` and add the ASCII values of the characters to `sum`.
- Calculate the difference between the sum of ASCII values of characters in `t` and the sum of ASCII values of characters in `s`.
- Convert this difference back to a character to get the added letter.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of string `t`.
Space Complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            sum += c;
        }
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            sum -= c;
        }
        return (char) Math.abs(sum);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            sum += c;
        }
        for (char c : t) {
            sum -= c;
        }
        return abs(sum);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        diff = 0
        for char in s:
            diff += ord(char)
        for char in t:
            diff -= ord(char)
        return chr(abs(diff))
```
