### Explanation
The problem can be solved by simulating the elimination process. We can keep track of the leftmost element, the current step size, and the direction of traversal. At each step, we update the leftmost element and the step size according to the rules of the elimination process until only one element remains.

### Algorithmic Idea
1. Initialize `left` to 1, `step` to 1, `remaining` to `n`, and `isLeftToRight` to true.
2. While `remaining` > 1:
   - If `isLeftToRight` is true or `remaining` is odd, update `left` to `left + step`.
   - Update `remaining` to `remaining / 2`.
   - Double the `step`.
   - Toggle the value of `isLeftToRight`.
3. Return `left`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) as we reduce the size of the problem by half at each step.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int left = 1, step = 1, remaining = n;
        boolean isLeftToRight = true;
        
        while (remaining > 1) {
            if (isLeftToRight || remaining % 2 == 1) {
                left += step;
            }
            remaining /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            isLeftToRight = !isLeftToRight;
        }
        
        return left;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int left = 1, step = 1, remaining = n;
        bool isLeftToRight = true;
        
        while (remaining > 1) {
            if (isLeftToRight || remaining % 2 == 1) {
                left += step;
            }
            remaining /= 2;
            step *= 2;
            isLeftToRight = !isLeftToRight;
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def lastRemaining(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, step, remaining = 1, 1, n
        is_left_to_right = True
        
        while remaining > 1:
            if is_left_to_right or remaining % 2 == 1:
                left += step
            remaining //= 2
            step *= 2
            is_left_to_right = not is_left_to_right
        
        return left
```
