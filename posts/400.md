## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the digit at the nth position in the infinite sequence of integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...]. The key idea is to first determine the range of numbers where the nth digit lies and then find the specific digit within that number.

1. Calculate the number of digits in each range of numbers: 1-9, 10-99, 100-999, and so on.
2. Find the range where the nth digit is located by subtracting the number of digits in each range from n until we find the correct range.
3. Determine the actual number where the nth digit is located within the range.
4. Find the specific digit at the nth position within that number.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) as we are iterating through the digits in the number ranges, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findNthDigit(int n) {
        int len = 1; 
        long count = 9;
        int start = 1;
        
        while (n > len * count) {
            n -= len * count;
            len++;
            count *= 10;
            start *= 10;
        }
        
        start += (n - 1) / len;
        String s = Integer.toString(start);
        return Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt((n - 1) % len));
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNthDigit(int n) {
        int len = 1;
        long count = 9;
        int start = 1;
        
        while (n > len * count) {
            n -= len * count;
            len++;
            count *= 10;
            start *= 10;
        }
        
        start += (n - 1) / len;
        string s = to_string(start);
        return s[(n - 1) % len] - '0';
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findNthDigit(self, n: int) -> int:
        len_ = 1
        count = 9
        start = 1
        
        while n > len_ * count:
            n -= len_ * count
            len_ += 1
            count *= 10
            start *= 10
        
        start += (n - 1) // len_
        s = str(start)
        return int(s[(n - 1) % len_])
```
