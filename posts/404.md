### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first traversal of the binary tree. While traversing, we keep track of whether a node is a left child and also whether it is a leaf node. If a node is a left child and a leaf node, we add its value to the sum.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of left leaves and start a depth-first traversal of the tree.
2. At each node, check if it is a leaf node and a left child. If it is, add its value to the sum.
3. Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees, passing the information about whether the current node is a left child or not.
4. Return the sum calculated during the traversal.

Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
Space Complexity: O(h) - where h is the height of the binary tree (recursion stack space).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        int sum = 0;
        if (root.left != null && root.left.left == null && root.left.right == null) {
            sum += root.left.val;
        }
        
        sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left) + sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right);
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;
        
        int sum = 0;
        if (root->left != nullptr && root->left->left == nullptr && root->left->right == nullptr) {
            sum += root->left->val;
        }
        
        sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root->left) + sumOfLeftLeaves(root->right);
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        sum = 0
        if root.left and not root.left.left and not root.left.right:
            sum += root.left.val
        
        sum += self.sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left) + self.sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right)
        
        return sum
