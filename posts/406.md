## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can first sort the people array in decreasing order of height and increasing order of number of people in front. Then, we can iterate through the sorted array and insert each person into their correct position in the final reconstructed queue.

### Algorithm:
1. Sort the `people` array in descending order of height and ascending order of number of people in front.
2. Iterate through the sorted array and insert each person at the index equal to their number of people in front.
3. As we insert people one by one, the taller people have already been added at their correct positions, so the shorter people do not affect the taller people's positions.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the number of people.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the reconstructed queue.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : b[0] - a[0]);
        List<int[]> queue = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] person : people) {
            queue.add(person[1], person);
        }
        
        return queue.toArray(new int[people.length][2]);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){
            return (a[0] == b[0]) ? a[1] < b[1] : a[0] > b[0];
        });
        
        vector<vector<int>> queue;
        for (const auto& person : people) {
            queue.insert(queue.begin() + person[1], person);
        }
        
        return queue;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        people.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        queue = []
        
        for person in people:
            queue.insert(person[1], person)
        
        return queue
```
