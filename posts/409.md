### Explanation:
To find the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with the given letters, we need to count the frequency of each letter in the input string. A palindrome can have an even count of each character, and at most one character can have an odd count (which will be placed in the middle of the palindrome). Hence, we can iterate over the counts of each character and calculate the length of the palindrome accordingly.

1. Initialize a variable `length` to store the length of the longest palindrome.
2. Iterate over the counts of each character in the input string.
3. For each character count, add the maximum even count (characterCount // 2 * 2) to the `length`.
4. If there is any character with an odd count, add 1 to the `length` (as it can be placed in the middle of the palindrome).
5. Return the final `length`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string s.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space to store the counts of characters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int[] charCounts = new int[128];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCounts[c]++;
        }
        
        int length = 0;
        for (int count : charCounts) {
            length += count / 2 * 2;
        }
        
        if (length < s.length()) {
            length++; // Add 1 for a single character that can be placed in the middle
        }
        
        return length;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        vector<int> charCounts(128, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            charCounts[c]++;
        }
        
        int length = 0;
        for (int count : charCounts) {
            length += count / 2 * 2;
        }
        
        if (length < s.length()) {
            length++; // Add 1 for a single character that can be placed in the middle
        }
        
        return length;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_counts = [0] * 128
        for c in s:
            char_counts[ord(c)] += 1
        
        length = 0
        for count in char_counts:
            length += count // 2 * 2
        
        if length < len(s):
            length += 1 # Add 1 for a single character that can be placed in the middle
        
        return length
```
