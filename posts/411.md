## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible abbreviations of the given target word. Then, for each abbreviation, we check if it conflicts with any of the words in the dictionary. We keep track of the minimum abbreviation that does not conflict with any word in the dictionary.

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Generate all possible abbreviations of the target word using backtracking.
2. For each abbreviation:
   - Check if it conflicts with any word in the dictionary.
   - If it does not conflict and the length of the abbreviation is less than the current minimum abbreviation length, update the minimum abbreviation.
3. Return the minimum abbreviation found.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n), where n is the length of the target word.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the target word.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String minAbbreviation(String target, String[] dictionary) {
        // Your Java solution here
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string minAbbreviation(string target, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        // Your C++ solution here
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minAbbreviation(self, target: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> str:
        # Your Python solution here
