## Explanation

The problem asks us to find how many times a given list of words can be fitted on a screen with a given number of rows and columns. We need to fit as many complete sentences as possible, where each sentence is constructed by appending words sequentially until the screen is filled.

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each row on the screen and keep track of the current index of the word list. We simulate the process of fitting words on the screen by calculating the number of complete sentences that can be formed.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a variable `wordsIndex` to keep track of the current index in the list of words.
2. Iterate through each row of the screen:
   - Initialize a variable `col` to represent the current column position.
   - While there is enough space on the current row to fit a word from the list:
     - Calculate the remaining space on the row after fitting a word.
     - If the remaining space is less than the length of the current word, break out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, increment the `col` by the length of the word and move to the next word in the list.
     - If we reach the end of the list, increment the number of sentences fitted and reset the `wordsIndex` to 0.
3. Return the total number of sentences fitted on the screen.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(rows + words.length), where rows is the number of rows on the screen and words is the list of words.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int wordsTyping(String[] sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int wordsIndex = 0;
        int sentenceCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            int col = 0;
            while (col + sentence[wordsIndex].length() <= cols) {
                col += sentence[wordsIndex].length() + 1;
                wordsIndex++;
                if (wordsIndex == sentence.length) {
                    sentenceCount++;
                    wordsIndex = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        return sentenceCount;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int wordsTyping(vector<string>& sentence, int rows, int cols) {
        int wordsIndex = 0;
        int sentenceCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            int col = 0;
            while (col + sentence[wordsIndex].length() <= cols) {
                col += sentence[wordsIndex].length() + 1;
                wordsIndex++;
                if (wordsIndex == sentence.size()) {
                    sentenceCount++;
                    wordsIndex = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        return sentenceCount;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence: List[str], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
        wordsIndex = 0
        sentenceCount = 0

        for i in range(rows):
            col = 0
            while col + len(sentence[wordsIndex]) <= cols:
                col += len(sentence[wordsIndex]) + 1
                wordsIndex += 1
                if wordsIndex == len(sentence):
                    sentenceCount += 1
                    wordsIndex = 0

        return sentenceCount
```
