### Explanation

To solve this problem efficiently, we can iterate through the board and count the number of battleships by checking if the current cell is a 'X' and if its left and top neighbors are not 'X'. This ensures that we are counting only the starting cells of battleships.

We will iterate through the board once and increment the count whenever we find a battleship's starting cell. At the end of the iteration, the count will represent the total number of battleships on the board.

- Time complexity: O(m*n) where m and n are the dimensions of the board
- Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X' && (i == 0 || board[i - 1][j] != 'X') && (j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] != 'X')) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X' && (i == 0 || board[i - 1][j] != 'X') && (j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] != 'X')) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[i][j] == 'X' and (i == 0 or board[i - 1][j] != 'X') and (j == 0 or board[i][j - 1] != 'X'):
                    count += 1
        return count
```
