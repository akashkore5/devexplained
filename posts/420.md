## Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to make a given password strong according to the conditions specified. We can break down the problem into the following steps:
1. Check if the password already meets the strong password criteria.
2. Identify the deficiencies in the password (length, missing character types, repeating characters).
3. Determine the steps needed to address each deficiency.
4. Return the total minimum steps required.
