### Explanation
To flatten a multilevel doubly linked list, we can use a stack to keep track of nodes with children. We start with the head node, and if a node has a child, we push its next node to the stack and connect the node to its child. We continue this process until all nodes have been flattened.

* Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the total number of nodes in the doubly linked list.
* Space Complexity: O(N) for the stack.

```java
class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        Node current = head;
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.child != null) {
                if (current.next != null) {
                    stack.push(current.next);
                }
                current.next = current.child;
                current.next.prev = current;
                current.child = null;
            }
            if (current.next == null && !stack.isEmpty()) {
                current.next = stack.pop();
                if (current.next != null) {
                    current.next.prev = current;
                }
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* flatten(Node* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) return nullptr;
        
        Node* current = head;
        stack<Node*> st;
        
        while (current != nullptr) {
            if (current->child != nullptr) {
                if (current->next != nullptr) {
                    st.push(current->next);
                }
                current->next = current->child;
                current->next->prev = current;
                current->child = nullptr;
            }
            if (current->next == nullptr && !st.empty()) {
                current->next = st.top();
                st.pop();
                if (current->next != nullptr) {
                    current->next->prev = current;
                }
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head:
            return None
        
        current = head
        stack = []
        
        while current:
            if current.child:
                if current.next:
                    stack.append(current.next)
                current.next = current.child
                current.next.prev = current
                current.child = None
            if not current.next and stack:
                current.next = stack.pop()
                if current.next:
                    current.next.prev = current
            current = current.next
            
        return head
```
