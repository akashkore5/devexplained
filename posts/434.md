### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and count the number of segments. We can identify a segment by looking for non-space characters. The number of segments will be equal to the number of transitions from a space character to a non-space character. We can handle edge cases by checking if the current character is not a space and the previous character is a space.

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(1) constant space is used.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countSegments(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && (i == 0 || s.charAt(i - 1) == ' ')) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSegments(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != ' ' && (i == 0 || s[i - 1] == ' ')) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countSegments(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] != ' ' and (i == 0 or s[i - 1] == ' '):
                count += 1
        return count
```
