## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. We know that the total number of coins needed to build a staircase with k rows is given by the formula `1 + 2 + ... + k = k * (k + 1) / 2`. We can use binary search to find the maximum number of complete rows that can be built with n coins.

1. Initialize left as 0 and right as n.
2. Perform binary search to find the maximum number of complete rows.
3. Calculate the total coins needed for mid rows using the formula.
4. Compare the total coins with n and adjust the search space accordingly.

The time complexity of this approach is O(log n) and the space complexity is O(1).
```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long left = 0, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long total = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (total == n) return (int)mid;
            else if (total < n) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return (int)right;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long left = 0, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long total = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if (total == n) return (int)mid;
            else if (total < n) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return (int)right;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, n
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            total = mid * (mid + 1) // 2
            if total == n:
                return mid
            elif total < n:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return right
```
