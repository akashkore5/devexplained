## Explanation
To solve this problem, we iterate through the input array of characters and maintain two pointers - `write` and `read`. The `read` pointer moves through the array to count consecutive repeating characters, while the `write` pointer updates the array in-place with the compressed characters. We keep track of the current character and count the number of consecutive occurrences. When the characters change, we update the array with the compressed representation. Finally, we return the length of the compressed array.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `chars`.
- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int write = 0;
        int start = 0;
        
        for (int read = 0; read < chars.length; read++) {
            if (read + 1 == chars.length || chars[read] != chars[read + 1]) {
                chars[write++] = chars[start];
                if (read > start) {
                    for (char c : String.valueOf(read - start + 1).toCharArray()) {
                        chars[write++] = c;
                    }
                }
                start = read + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return write;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        int write = 0;
        int start = 0;
        
        for (int read = 0; read < chars.size(); read++) {
            if (read + 1 == chars.size() || chars[read] != chars[read + 1]) {
                chars[write++] = chars[start];
                if (read > start) {
                    string count = to_string(read - start + 1);
                    for (char c : count) {
                        chars[write++] = c;
                    }
                }
                start = read + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return write;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        write = start = 0
        
        for read in range(len(chars)):
            if read + 1 == len(chars) or chars[read] != chars[read + 1]:
                chars[write] = chars[start]
                write += 1
                if read > start:
                    for c in str(read - start + 1):
                        chars[write] = c
                        write += 1
                start = read + 1
        
        return write
```
