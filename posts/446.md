## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming along with a hashmap to keep track of the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index. We iterate through the array and for each pair of elements, we calculate the difference and update the hashmap accordingly. We can then use this information to calculate the total number of arithmetic subsequences.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a hashmap `dp` to store the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index.
2. Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the total number of arithmetic subsequences.
3. Iterate through the array.
4. For each element at index `i`, iterate through all elements before `i` to calculate the difference `diff` with the element at index `j`.
5. If there exists a subsequence ending at `j` with difference `diff`, increment `dp[i]` by the count of such subsequences.
6. Add `dp[j]` to `dp[i]` (since we can append the current element to any valid subsequence ending at `j` to form a new subsequence ending at `i`).
7. Update `total` by adding `dp[i]`.
8. Return `total`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int total = 0;
        
        Map<Integer, Integer>[] dp = new Map[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = new HashMap<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                long diff = (long)nums[i] - nums[j];
                if (diff <= Integer.MIN_VALUE || diff > Integer.MAX_VALUE) continue;
                
                int diffInt = (int)diff;
                int sum = dp[j].getOrDefault(diffInt, 0);
                int original = dp[i].getOrDefault(diffInt, 0);
                
                dp[i].put(diffInt, original + sum + 1);
                total += sum;
            }
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int total = 0;
        
        unordered_map<int, int> dp[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                long diff = (long)nums[i] - nums[j];
                if (diff <= INT_MIN || diff > INT_MAX) continue;
                
                int diffInt = (int)diff;
                int sum = dp[j].count(diffInt) ? dp[j][diffInt] : 0;
                int original = dp[i].count(diffInt) ? dp[i][diffInt] : 0;
                
                dp[i][diffInt] = original + sum + 1;
                total += sum;
            }
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total = 0
        
        dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                diff = nums[i] - nums[j]
                if diff <= -2**31 or diff > 2**31 - 1:
                    continue
                
                diff_int = int(diff)
                sum_val = dp[j].get(diff_int, 0)
                original = dp[i].get(diff_int, 0)
                
                dp[i][diff_int] = original + sum_val + 1
                total += sum_val
        
        return total
