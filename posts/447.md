### Explanation:
- We can solve this problem by iterating through each point and calculating the distances to all other points.
- We will use a hashmap to store the count of distances for each point.
- For each point, we calculate the distance to all other points and store them in the hashmap.
- For any two points with the same distance, we can form a boomerang with the current point.
- The number of boomerangs for a single point is calculated by choosing 2 points out of n, which is n*(n-1).
- Finally, we sum up the number of boomerangs for each point to get the total count.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) - We iterate through all points and calculate distances to all other points.
Space Complexity: O(n) - We use a hashmap to store distances for each point.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfBoomerangs(int[][] points) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            Map<Integer, Integer> distances = new HashMap<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < points.length; j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                int dist = (int) (Math.pow(points[i][0] - points[j][0], 2) + Math.pow(points[i][1] - points[j][1], 2));
                distances.put(dist, distances.getOrDefault(dist, 0) + 1);
            }
            for (int val : distances.values()) {
                count += val * (val - 1);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBoomerangs(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            unordered_map<int, int> distances;
            for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;
                int dist = pow(points[i][0] - points[j][0], 2) + pow(points[i][1] - points[j][1], 2);
                distances[dist]++;
            }
            for (auto& it : distances) {
                count += it.second * (it.second - 1);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(points)):
            distances = {}
            for j in range(len(points)):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                dist = (points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2
                distances[dist] = distances.get(dist, 0) + 1
            for val in distances.values():
                count += val * (val - 1)
        return count
