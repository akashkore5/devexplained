## Explanation

To find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all the balloons, we can sort the balloons based on their end points. We then iterate through the sorted balloons and keep track of the current end point. If the current balloon's start point is greater than the current end point, we need to shoot a new arrow. We update the current end point to be the minimum of the current end point and the end point of the current balloon.

Time complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of balloons (sorting)
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if (points.length == 0) return 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        
        int arrows = 1;
        int end = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                arrows++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return arrows;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        if (points.empty()) return 0;
        
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        int arrows = 1;
        int end = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                arrows++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return arrows;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points:
            return 0
        
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        arrows = 1
        end = points[0][1]
        
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            if points[i][0] > end:
                arrows += 1
                end = points[i][1]
        
        return arrows
```
