### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of moves required to make all elements in the array equal. We can observe that incrementing `n-1` elements by 1 is equivalent to decrementing 1 element by 1. Therefore, we can restate the problem as finding the number of moves needed to make all elements in the array equal to the minimum element in the array.

The algorithmic idea is to calculate the sum of differences between each element and the minimum element in the array. This sum represents the total number of moves needed to equalize all elements.

1. Find the minimum element in the array.
2. Calculate the sum of differences between each element and the minimum element.
3. Return the sum as the output.

**Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            sum += num;
        }
        
        return sum - min * nums.length;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMoves(vector<int>& nums) {
        int min = INT_MAX;
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            min = std::min(min, num);
            sum += num;
        }
        
        return sum - min * nums.size();
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_val = min(nums)
        total_moves = sum(nums) - min_val * len(nums)
        return total_moves
```
