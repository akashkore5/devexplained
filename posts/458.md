### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of pigs required to determine the poisonous bucket within the given time constraints. We can approach this by treating each pig as a digit in a base "buckets + 1" number system. By feeding the pigs in a specific pattern, we can map each possible outcome to a unique number, and then determine the poisonous bucket based on the number of pigs that die.

1. If we have 1 pig, it can check up to (minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1) buckets. This is because if the pig survives, we can determine the poisonous bucket from the buckets that were fed to it.
2. If we have 2 pigs, we can represent each pig's outcome as a digit in a base (buckets + 1) number system. By feeding the pigs in a specific pattern, we can map each possible outcome to a unique number.
3. We continue this process for the required number of pigs until we can uniquely determine the poisonous bucket within the given time limit.

Time Complexity: O(log(buckets))  
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int pigs = 0;
        int tests = minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1;
        while (Math.pow(tests, pigs) < buckets) {
            pigs++;
        }
        return pigs;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int pigs = 0;
        int tests = minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1;
        while (pow(tests, pigs) < buckets) {
            pigs++;
        }
        return pigs;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:
        pigs = 0
        tests = minutesToTest // minutesToDie + 1
        while tests ** pigs < buckets:
            pigs += 1
        return pigs
```
