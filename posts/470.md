## Explanation
To implement `rand10()` using `rand7()`, we need to first understand the concept of rejection sampling. The idea is to generate a number in the desired range by discarding numbers that fall outside that range. In this case, we can call `rand7()` twice to generate numbers in the range [1, 49]. We then map these numbers to the range [1, 10] by rejecting those greater than 40 and mapping the rest to the range [1, 10].

The expected value for the number of calls to `rand7()` is around 2.45, as we discard some numbers during the rejection sampling process.

### Algorithm:
1. Generate two random numbers `x` and `y` in the range [1, 7].
2. Calculate `num = (x-1) * 7 + y` to get a number in the range [1, 49].
3. If `num > 40`, reject and repeat the process. Otherwise, return `num % 10 + 1`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) on average.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1).
```java
class Solution {
    public int rand10() {
        while (true) {
            int num = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7();
            if (num <= 40) {
                return num % 10 + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    private int rand7() {
        // Assume this is provided
        return 0;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rand10() {
        while (true) {
            int num = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7();
            if (num <= 40) {
                return num % 10 + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    int rand7() {
        // Assume this is provided
        return 0;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def rand10(self) -> int:
        while True:
            num = (self.rand7() - 1) * 7 + self.rand7()
            if num <= 40:
                return num % 10 + 1

    def rand7(self) -> int:
        # Assume this is provided
        return 0
```
