### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the arrays `houses` and `heaters`.
2. For each house, find the closest heater to the left and the closest heater to the right.
3. Calculate the distance between the house and the closest heater.
4. The minimum radius needed to cover all houses will be the maximum distance calculated in step 3.

Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the total number of houses and heaters.
Space complexity: O(1)

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findRadius(int[] houses, int[] heaters) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        Arrays.sort(heaters);
        
        int radius = 0;
        for (int house : houses) {
            int closestHeaterDist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int heater : heaters) {
                closestHeaterDist = Math.min(closestHeaterDist, Math.abs(house - heater));
            }
            radius = Math.max(radius, closestHeaterDist);
        }
        
        return radius;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int findRadius(std::vector<int>& houses, std::vector<int>& heaters) {
        std::sort(houses.begin(), houses.end());
        std::sort(heaters.begin(), heaters.end());
        
        int radius = 0;
        for (int house : houses) {
            int closestHeaterDist = INT_MAX;
            for (int heater : heaters) {
                closestHeaterDist = std::min(closestHeaterDist, abs(house - heater));
            }
            radius = std::max(radius, closestHeaterDist);
        }
        
        return radius;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        houses.sort()
        heaters.sort()
        
        radius = 0
        for house in houses:
            closest_heater_dist = float('inf')
            for heater in heaters:
                closest_heater_dist = min(closest_heater_dist, abs(house - heater))
            radius = max(radius, closest_heater_dist)
        
        return radius
```
