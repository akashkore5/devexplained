### Explanation:
To find the complement of an integer, we need to flip all the bits in its binary representation. We can achieve this by iterating through each bit of the number and toggling it (flipping 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). We can do this by using XOR operation with a bitmask that has all 1's of the same length as the number.

1. Find the number of bits needed to represent the given number.
2. Create a bitmask with all 1's of the same length as the number.
3. XOR the number with the bitmask to get the complement.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this approach is O(log n) where n is the given number.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;
        return num ^ mask;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int mask = (int)(pow(2, (int)log2(num) + 1)) - 1;
        return num ^ mask;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        mask = (1 << num.bit_length()) - 1
        return num ^ mask
```
