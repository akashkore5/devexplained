### Explanation
To solve this problem efficiently, we can observe that the Hamming distance between two numbers can be calculated by counting the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in their XOR result. We can iterate through each bit position (from 0 to 31 for integers) and count the number of elements that have that bit set and the number of elements that have that bit unset. The total Hamming distance is then the product of these two counts for each bit position summed up.

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int totalDistance = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int setBits = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if ((num & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    setBits++;
                }
            }
            totalDistance += setBits * (nums.length - setBits);
        }
        return totalDistance;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalHammingDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
        int totalDistance = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int setBits = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if ((num & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    setBits++;
                }
            }
            totalDistance += setBits * (nums.size() - setBits);
        }
        return totalDistance;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def totalHammingDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        total_distance = 0
        for i in range(32):
            set_bits = sum((num >> i) & 1 for num in nums)
            total_distance += set_bits * (len(nums) - set_bits)
        return total_distance
```
