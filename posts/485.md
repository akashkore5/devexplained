### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the binary array `nums` and keep track of the current consecutive count of 1s. We update the maximum consecutive count whenever we encounter a 0 or reach the end of the array. Finally, we return the maximum consecutive count.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize variables `maxConsecutive` and `currentConsecutive` to 0.
  2. Iterate through the array `nums`:
     - If the current element is 1, increment `currentConsecutive`.
     - If the current element is 0, update `maxConsecutive` if `currentConsecutive` is greater and reset `currentConsecutive` to 0.
  3. Update `maxConsecutive` with the final `currentConsecutive`.
  4. Return `maxConsecutive`.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the binary array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int maxConsecutive = 0;
        int currentConsecutive = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                currentConsecutive++;
            } else {
                maxConsecutive = Math.max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
                currentConsecutive = 0;
            }
        }
        
        maxConsecutive = Math.max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
        
        return maxConsecutive;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxConsecutive = 0;
        int currentConsecutive = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                currentConsecutive++;
            } else {
                maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
                currentConsecutive = 0;
            }
        }
        
        maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive);
        
        return maxConsecutive;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxConsecutive = 0
        currentConsecutive = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                currentConsecutive += 1
            else:
                maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive)
                currentConsecutive = 0
        
        maxConsecutive = max(maxConsecutive, currentConsecutive)
        
        return maxConsecutive
```
