## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum score player 1 can get from nums[i:j+1]. The base cases are when i==j, dp[i][i] = nums[i] and when i > j, dp[i][j] = 0.

The dynamic programming approach involves filling up the dp array diagonally. We iterate over the array in a way that we first fill up for all subsequences of length 1, then length 2, and so on up to the length of the full array.

At each step, we consider two options: either player 1 picks nums[i] or nums[j]. If player 1 picks nums[i], then player 2 will play optimally and player 1 will get the remaining score from dp[i+1][j]. Similarly, if player 1 picks nums[j], then player 2 will play optimally and player 1 will get the remaining score from dp[i][j-1].

Finally, we check if the score player 1 can get by following the above strategy is greater than or equal to half of the total sum of the array. If it is, then player 1 can win the game.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = nums[i];
        }

        for (int len = 1; len < n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len;
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = nums[i];
        }

        for (int len = 1; len < n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len;
                dp[i][j] = max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def PredictTheWinner(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = nums[i]

        for length in range(1, n):
            for i in range(n - length):
                j = i + length
                dp[i][j] = max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1])

        return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0
