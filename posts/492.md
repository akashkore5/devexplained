## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of a rectangle with a given area such that the difference between the length and width is minimized. We can start by iterating from the square root of the given area down to 1 and checking if the current number is a valid width for the given area. If we find a valid width, we can calculate the corresponding length and return the result.

- Start iterating from the square root of the given area down to 1
- Check if the current number is a valid width by dividing the area by the current number and checking if the remainder is 0
- If a valid width is found, calculate the length and return the result

Time complexity: O(sqrt(area))
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int width = (int) Math.sqrt(area);
        while (area % width != 0) {
            width--;
        }
        return new int[]{area / width, width};
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
        int width = sqrt(area);
        while (area % width != 0) {
            width--;
        }
        return {area / width, width};
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def constructRectangle(self, area: int) -> List[int]:
        width = int(area ** 0.5)
        while area % width != 0:
            width -= 1
        return [area // width, width]
```
