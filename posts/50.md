## Explanation:
To calculate x raised to the power of n, we can use the concept of exponentiation by squaring. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems by dividing the power n by 2 in each step. By recursively solving these subproblems, we can efficiently compute the result. If n is even, we can square the result of x raised to the power of n/2. If n is odd, we need to multiply the result of x raised to the power of n/2 with itself and x. This approach optimizes the number of multiplications required.

### Algorithm:
1. If n is 0, return 1.
2. If n is negative, update x to 1/x and n to -n to handle negative exponents.
3. Initialize a variable result to 1.
4. Loop while n is greater than 0:
   - If n is odd, multiply result by x.
   - Update x to x squared.
   - Divide n by 2.
5. Return result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) as we are reducing the problem size by half in each step.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            n = -n;
        }
        
        double result = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 1) {
                result *= x;
            }
            x *= x;
            n /= 2;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            n = -n;
        }
        
        double result = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 1) {
                result *= x;
            }
            x *= x;
            n /= 2;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n
        
        result = 1
        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 == 1:
                result *= x
            x *= x
            n //= 2
        
        return result
```
