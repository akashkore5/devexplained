## Explanation

In this problem, we are given a node in a binary search tree (BST) and we need to find the inorder successor of that node. The inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's key.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. If the given node has a right child, then the inorder successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree.
2. If the given node does not have a right child, then we need to traverse up the tree until we find a node that is the left child of its parent. The parent node of such a node will be the inorder successor.

By following these steps, we can find the inorder successor for the given node efficiently.

Time complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
Space complexity: O(1).
```java
public Node inorderSuccessor(Node node) {
    if (node.right != null) {
        Node curr = node.right;
        while (curr.left != null) {
            curr = curr.left;
        }
        return curr;
    } else {
        Node parent = node.parent;
        while (parent != null && node == parent.right) {
            node = parent;
            parent = parent.parent;
        }
        return parent;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
Node* inorderSuccessor(Node* node) {
    if (node->right != nullptr) {
        Node* curr = node->right;
        while (curr->left != nullptr) {
            curr = curr->left;
        }
        return curr;
    } else {
        Node* parent = node->parent;
        while (parent != nullptr && node == parent->right) {
            node = parent;
            parent = parent->parent;
        }
        return parent;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def inorderSuccessor(node):
    if node.right:
        curr = node.right
        while curr.left:
            curr = curr.left
        return curr
    else:
        parent = node.parent
        while parent and node == parent.right:
            node = parent
            parent = parent.parent
        return parent
```
