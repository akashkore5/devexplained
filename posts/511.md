## Explanation
To find the first login date for each player, we need to group the records by `player_id` and then select the minimum `event_date` for each player.

The algorithmic idea is to use a `GROUP BY` query along with the `MIN` function to find the first login date for each player.

- Group the records by `player_id`.
- Select the minimum `event_date` for each group.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of records in the `Activity` table. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result.
```java
# Write your Java solution here
String sql = "SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id;";
```

### C++
```cpp
// Write your C++ solution here
string sql = "SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id;";
```

### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
sql = "SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id;"
```
