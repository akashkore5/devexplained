## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to write an SQL query to find the average number of sessions per user in a game. We can achieve this by grouping the data by user_id and calculating the average of the number of sessions for each user.

### Algorithm:
1. Use the GROUP BY clause to group the data by user_id.
2. Use the AVG() function to calculate the average of the number of sessions for each user.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the SQL query is O(N), where N is the number of rows in the input table.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the SQL query is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size.

:

### SQL:
```sql
SELECT user_id, AVG(sessions) AS average_sessions
FROM Activity
GROUP BY user_id;
```
:
```java
// SQL query can be executed directly using JDBC or any ORM framework
// No additional Java code is needed for this problem
```

### C++:
```cpp
// SQL query can be executed using libraries like libmysqlclient
// No additional C++ code is needed for this problem
```

### Python:
```python
# SQL query can be executed using libraries like pymysql or sqlite3
# No additional Python code is needed for this problem
```
