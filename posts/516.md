### Explanation
To find the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequence for each substring. The base case would be when the length of the substring is 1, in which case the longest palindromic subsequence length would be 1.

We iterate through the string `s` and fill the `dp` array based on the following cases:
- If `s[i] == s[j]`, we can include both characters in the palindromic subsequence, so we add 2 to the length of the palindromic subsequence ending at `i` and `j`.
- If `s[i] != s[j]`, we take the maximum of the length of the palindromic subsequence ending at `i-1` and `j` or `i` and `j-1`.

The final answer will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the input string.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.
**Space Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n-1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n-1];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            dp[i][i] = 1
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
