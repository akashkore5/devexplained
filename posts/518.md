### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 1D array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations to make up amount `i`. We initialize `dp[0]` as 1, since there is one way to make up amount 0, which is by using no coins. Then, for each coin, we iterate through all amounts from the coin value to the target amount and update the number of combinations accordingly.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a 1D array `dp` of size `amount + 1` with all values set to 0, except `dp[0] = 1`.
2. Iterate through each coin in the `coins` array.
3. For each coin, iterate through all amounts from the coin value to the target amount.
4. Update `dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - coin]` to accumulate the number of combinations.

**Time Complexity:** O(amount * n), where n is the number of coins
**Space Complexity:** O(amount)
```java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int j = coin; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
            }
        }

        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int j = coin; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
            }
        }

        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 1

        for coin in coins:
            for j in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[j] += dp[j - coin]

        return dp[amount]
```
