## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the dictionary and check if each word can be formed by deleting characters from the given string `s`. We can achieve this by using two pointers to compare the characters of both the word in the dictionary and the given string. If a word in the dictionary can be formed by deleting characters from `s`, we update our answer if the current word is longer or if it has the same length but smaller lexicographical order.

### Algorithm
1. Sort the dictionary in lexicographical order to handle the tie-breaker condition.
2. Iterate through each word in the dictionary and perform the following steps:
   - Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse through the word in the dictionary and the given string `s` respectively.
   - While `i` and `j` are within bounds, compare the characters at the current positions. If they match, increment both pointers. Otherwise, only increment `j`.
   - If `i` reaches the end of the word, it means the current word can be formed by deleting characters from `s`. Update the answer if the current word is longer or has the same length but smaller lexicographical order.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m * log m), where n is the number of words in the dictionary and m is the average length of the words in the dictionary. The sorting of the dictionary contributes to the log m factor.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public String findLongestWord(String s, List<String> dictionary) {
        String result = "";
        Collections.sort(dictionary, (a, b) -> a.length() != b.length() ? b.length() - a.length() : a.compareTo(b));
        
        for (String word : dictionary) {
            int i = 0, j = 0;
            while (i < word.length() && j < s.length()) {
                if (word.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    i++;
                }
                j++;
            }
            
            if (i == word.length() && (word.length() > result.length() || (word.length() == result.length() && word.compareTo(result) < 0))) {
                result = word;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLongestWord(string s, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        string result = "";
        sort(dictionary.begin(), dictionary.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
            return a.length() != b.length() ? b.length() < a.length() : a < b;
        });
        
        for (const string& word : dictionary) {
            int i = 0, j = 0;
            while (i < word.length() && j < s.length()) {
                if (word[i] == s[j]) {
                    i++;
                }
                j++;
            }
            
            if (i == word.length() && (word.length() > result.length() || (word.length() == result.length() && word < result))) {
                result = word;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findLongestWord(self, s: str, dictionary: List[str]) -> str:
        result = ""
        dictionary.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), x))
        
        for word in dictionary:
            i, j = 0, 0
            while i < len(word) and j < len(s):
                if word[i] == s[j]:
                    i += 1
                j += 1
                
            if i == len(word) and (len(word) > len(result) or (len(word) == len(result) and word < result)):
                result = word
        
        return result
```
