### Explanation:
We can solve this problem by keeping track of the running sum of zeros and ones encountered while iterating through the array. We store the running sum in a hashmap where the key is the running sum and the value is the index at which that running sum was encountered. If we encounter the same running sum again, it means that the subarray between the two occurrences has equal numbers of zeros and ones. We calculate the length of this subarray and update the maximum length found so far.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a hashmap `map` with key 0 and value -1.
2. Initialize variables `maxLen` to store the maximum length found so far and `count` to keep track of the running sum (count of ones - count of zeros).
3. Iterate through the input array.
4. For each element, update the `count` variable accordingly (increment by 1 if it is 1, decrement if it is 0).
5. If `count` is already present in the `map`, calculate the length of the subarray and update `maxLen` if needed.
6. If `count` is not in the `map`, add it with the current index.
7. Return `maxLen` as the result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, -1);
        int maxLen = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            count += nums[i] == 1 ? 1 : -1;
            if (map.containsKey(count)) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - map.get(count));
            } else {
                map.put(count, i);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        map[0] = -1;
        int maxLen = 0, count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            count += nums[i] == 1 ? 1 : -1;
            if (map.find(count) != map.end()) {
                maxLen = max(maxLen, i - map[count]);
            } else {
                map[count] = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        map = {0: -1}
        maxLen = 0
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count += 1 if nums[i] == 1 else -1
            if count in map:
                maxLen = max(maxLen, i - map[count])
            else:
                map[count] = i
        
        return maxLen
```
