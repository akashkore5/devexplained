## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of players who played at least three consecutive rounds and their player ID. We can iterate through the `Activity` table ordered by `player_id` and `event_date`, and use a window function to count the consecutive rounds played by each player. Then, we can filter out the players who played at least three consecutive rounds.

**Algorithm:**
1. Use a window function to calculate the row number partitioned by `player_id` and ordered by `event_date`.
2. Use a subquery to filter out the players who played at least three consecutive rounds.
3. Select the distinct `player_id` from the subquery.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Activity` table.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT DISTINCT player_id
FROM (
    SELECT player_id, event_date, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) as row_num
    FROM Activity
) AS temp
WHERE temp.row_num >= 3
```

### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT DISTINCT player_id
FROM (
    SELECT player_id, event_date, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) as row_num
    FROM Activity
) AS temp
WHERE temp.row_num >= 3
```

### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT DISTINCT player_id
FROM (
    SELECT player_id, event_date, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) as row_num
    FROM Activity
) AS temp
WHERE temp.row_num >= 3
```
