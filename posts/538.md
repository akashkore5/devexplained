### Explanation
To convert a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a Greater Tree, we can perform a reverse in-order traversal of the tree. In a reverse in-order traversal, we visit nodes in the right subtree first, followed by the current node, and then the left subtree. During this traversal, we keep track of the running sum of nodes visited so far. At each node, we update its value by adding the running sum to it.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the running sum.
2. Perform a reverse in-order traversal of the BST.
3. For each node visited:
   - Update the node's value by adding `sum` to it.
   - Update `sum` by adding the node's value to it.
4. Return the modified root of the BST.

Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the BST.
Space Complexity: O(h) - where h is the height of the BST.

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;

    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            convertBST(root.right);
            sum += root.val;
            root.val = sum;
            convertBST(root.left);
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int sum = 0;
    
    TreeNode* convertBST(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root != nullptr) {
            convertBST(root->right);
            sum += root->val;
            root->val = sum;
            convertBST(root->left);
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sum = 0

    def convertBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if root:
            self.convertBST(root.right)
            self.sum += root.val
            root.val = self.sum
            self.convertBST(root.left)
        return root
```
