## Explanation

To find the single element in a sorted array with elements appearing twice except for one element, we can utilize the property of the array being sorted. We can perform a binary search to efficiently find the single element.

1. We start by initializing two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the beginning and end of the array respectively.
2. We calculate the middle index `mid`.
3. We check if the middle element is the single element or if it is on the left or right side.
4. If the middle element is not the single element, we check if the single element lies on the left or right side based on the following conditions:
   - If `mid` is even and `mid + 1` element is equal to `mid` element, then the single element is on the right side, so we move `low` to `mid + 2`.
   - If `mid` is odd and `mid - 1` element is equal to `mid` element, then the single element is on the right side, so we move `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the single element is on the left side, so we move `high` to `mid - 1`.
5. Repeat the above steps until `low` and `high` converge, then return the element at `low`.

The time complexity of this approach is O(log n) as we are reducing the search space by half in each iteration, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid % 2 == 1) {
                mid--; // Ensure mid is always on even index
            }
            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {
                low = mid + 2;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[low];
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid % 2 == 1) {
                mid--; // Ensure mid is always on even index
            }
            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {
                low = mid + 2;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[low];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while low < high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            if mid % 2 == 1:
                mid -= 1  # Ensure mid is always on even index
            if nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]:
                low = mid + 2
            else:
                high = mid
        return nums[low]
```
