## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We start by creating an array of strings representing the initial teams. Then, we recursively pair up teams by concatenating the first and last elements, second and second-to-last elements, and so on. We continue this process until we have only one string left, which represents the final match.

Here are the steps for the algorithm:
1. Initialize an array of strings representing the teams.
2. Write a recursive function that takes in the array of strings and recursively pairs up teams until only one string is left.
3. In each recursive call, create a new array and pair up teams by concatenating the first and last elements, second and second-to-last elements, and so on.
4. Continue this process until only one string is left, representing the final match.
5. Return the final match string.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of teams.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of teams.

:
```java
class Solution {
    public String findContestMatch(int n) {
        String[] teams = new String[n];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            teams[i - 1] = String.valueOf(i);
        }
        return findContestMatchHelper(teams);
    }
    
    private String findContestMatchHelper(String[] teams) {
        if (teams.length == 1) {
            return teams[0];
        }
        
        String[] newTeams = new String[teams.length / 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < teams.length / 2; i++) {
            newTeams[i] = "(" + teams[i] + "," + teams[teams.length - 1 - i] + ")";
        }
        
        return findContestMatchHelper(newTeams);
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findContestMatch(int n) {
        vector<string> teams(n);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            teams[i - 1] = to_string(i);
        }
        return findContestMatchHelper(teams);
    }
    
    string findContestMatchHelper(vector<string>& teams) {
        if (teams.size() == 1) {
            return teams[0];
        }
        
        vector<string> newTeams(teams.size() / 2);
        for (int i = 0; i < teams.size() / 2; i++) {
            newTeams[i] = "(" + teams[i] + "," + teams[teams.size() - 1 - i] + ")";
        }
        
        return findContestMatchHelper(newTeams);
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def findContestMatch(self, n: int) -> str:
        teams = [str(i) for i in range(1, n+1)]
        return self.findContestMatchHelper(teams)
    
    def findContestMatchHelper(self, teams: List[str]) -> str:
        if len(teams) == 1:
            return teams[0]
        
        new_teams = []
        for i in range(len(teams) // 2):
            new_teams.append("(" + teams[i] + "," + teams[len(teams) - 1 - i] + ")")
        
        return self.findContestMatchHelper(new_teams)
```
