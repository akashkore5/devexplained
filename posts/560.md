## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a HashMap to keep track of the cumulative sum of subarrays and their frequencies. By calculating the cumulative sum as we iterate through the array, we can check if there exists a subarray with sum k by checking if the difference between the current cumulative sum and k has been seen before. If it has, then there exists a subarray with sum k ending at the current index. We increment the count by the frequency of the cumulative sum difference.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a HashMap to store cumulative sums and their frequencies. Also, initialize the count of subarrays with sum k and the cumulative sum to 0.
2. Iterate over the array:
   - Calculate the cumulative sum by adding the current element to the previous cumulative sum.
   - Check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and k has been seen before in the HashMap. If yes, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
   - Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum in the HashMap.
3. Return the count of subarrays with sum k.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, 1);
        int count = 0, sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (map.containsKey(sum - k)) {
                count += map.get(sum - k);
            }
            map.put(sum, map.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        map[0] = 1;
        int count = 0, sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            if (map.find(sum - k) != map.end()) {
                count += map[sum - k];
            }
            map[sum]++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        sum_map = {0: 1}
        curr_sum = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            curr_sum += num
            if curr_sum - k in sum_map:
                count += sum_map[curr_sum - k]
            sum_map[curr_sum] = sum_map.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1
        
        return count
```
