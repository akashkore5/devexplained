## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. We will create a 2D array to store the maximum vacation days that can be accumulated up to each city for each week. We will iterate over each week and each city, and calculate the maximum vacation days that can be accumulated at that city for that week by considering the maximum vacation days accumulated at the previous city for the previous week plus the vacation days for the current city for the current week. We will update the values in the 2D array as we iterate through the weeks and cities.

At the end of the iteration, the maximum vacation days that can be accumulated at the last city for the last week will be our final result.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `n x k` where `n` is the number of cities and `k` is the number of weeks.
2. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to be equal to the vacation days at the first city for the first week.
3. Iterate over each week starting from the second week:
   - For each city, calculate the maximum vacation days that can be accumulated at that city for that week:
     - For each previous city, calculate the maximum vacation days that can be accumulated at the previous city for the previous week and add the vacation days for the current city for the current week.
     - Update the value in `dp` if it is greater than the current value.
4. Return the maximum vacation days that can be accumulated at the last city for the last week.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * k^2) where `n` is the number of cities and `k` is the number of weeks.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n * k) for the 2D array `dp` used for memoization.

    public int maxVacationDays(int[][] flights, int[][] days) {
        int n = flights.length;
        int k = days[0].length;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][k];
        dp[0][0] = days[0][0];
        
        for (int week = 1; week < k; week++) {
            for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {
                dp[city][week] = dp[city][week - 1] + days[city][week];
                for (int prevCity = 0; prevCity < n; prevCity++) {
                    if (flights[prevCity][city] == 1) {
                        dp[city][week] = Math.max(dp[city][week], dp[prevCity][week - 1] + days[city][week]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxVacation = 0;
        for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {
            maxVacation = Math.max(maxVacation, dp[city][k - 1]);
        }
        
        return maxVacation;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxVacationDays(vector<vector<int>>& flights, vector<vector<int>>& days) {
        int n = flights.size();
        int k = days[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(k, 0));
        dp[0][0] = days[0][0];
        
        for (int week = 1; week < k; week++) {
            for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {
                dp[city][week] = dp[city][week - 1] + days[city][week];
                for (int prevCity = 0; prevCity < n; prevCity++) {
                    if (flights[prevCity][city] == 1) {
                        dp[city][week] = max(dp[city][week], dp[prevCity][week - 1] + days[city][week]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxVacation = 0;
        for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {
            maxVacation = max(maxVacation, dp[city][k - 1]);
        }
        
        return maxVacation;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxVacationDays(self, flights: List[List[int]], days: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(flights)
        k = len(days[0])
        
        dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n)]
        dp[0][0] = days[0][0]
        
        for week in range(1, k):
            for city in range(n):
                dp[city][week] = dp[city][week - 1] + days[city][week]
                for prevCity in range(n):
                    if flights[prevCity][city] == 1:
                        dp[city][week] = max(dp[city][week], dp[prevCity][week - 1] + days[city][week])
        
        maxVacation = 0
        for city in range(n):
            maxVacation = max(maxVacation, dp[city][k - 1])
        
        return maxVacation
