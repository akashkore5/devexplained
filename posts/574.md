### Explanation:
To find the winning candidate in an election, we need to count the votes for each candidate and determine the candidate with the highest number of votes. If there is a tie, we need to return the candidate with the lowest ID.

1. Create a map to store the count of votes for each candidate.
2. Iterate through the votes array and update the count of votes for each candidate in the map.
3. Find the candidate with the highest number of votes and the lowest ID.
4. Return the ID of the winning candidate.

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of votes.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(n) to store the count of votes for each candidate.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public String findWinner(String[] votes) {
        Map<String, Integer> voteCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        String winner = "";
        int maxVotes = 0;
        
        for (String vote : votes) {
            voteCount.put(vote, voteCount.getOrDefault(vote, 0) + 1);
            if (voteCount.get(vote) > maxVotes || (voteCount.get(vote) == maxVotes && vote.compareTo(winner) < 0)) {
                maxVotes = voteCount.get(vote);
                winner = vote;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findWinner(vector<string>& votes) {
        unordered_map<string, int> voteCount;
        
        string winner = "";
        int maxVotes = 0;
        
        for (const auto& vote : votes) {
            voteCount[vote]++;
            if (voteCount[vote] > maxVotes || (voteCount[vote] == maxVotes && vote < winner)) {
                maxVotes = voteCount[vote];
                winner = vote;
            }
        }
        
        return winner;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findWinner(self, votes: List[str]) -> str:
        vote_count = {}
        winner = ""
        max_votes = 0
        
        for vote in votes:
            vote_count[vote] = vote_count.get(vote, 0) + 1
            if vote_count[vote] > max_votes or (vote_count[vote] == max_votes and vote < winner):
                max_votes = vote_count[vote]
                winner = vote
        
        return winner
```
