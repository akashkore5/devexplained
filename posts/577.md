### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to join the `Employee` table with the `Bonus` table on `empId` and filter out the rows where the bonus amount is less than 1000. We can achieve this using a simple SQL query.

:

#### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL
