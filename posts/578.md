### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the question with the highest answer rate. The answer rate for a question is calculated as the number of answers divided by the number of views.

We can achieve this by iterating over each question, calculating the answer rate for each question, and keeping track of the question with the highest answer rate.

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the highest answer rate and the corresponding question id.
2. Iterate over each question and calculate the answer rate.
3. If the current answer rate is higher than the previous highest answer rate, update the highest answer rate and the corresponding question id.
4. Return the question id with the highest answer rate.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int getHighestAnswerRateQuestion(int[][] questions) {
        int highestQuestionId = -1;
        double highestAnswerRate = 0.0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
            int views = questions[i][0];
            int answers = questions[i][1];
            double answerRate = (double) answers / views;
            
            if (answerRate > highestAnswerRate) {
                highestAnswerRate = answerRate;
                highestQuestionId = i;
            }
        }
        
        return highestQuestionId;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getHighestAnswerRateQuestion(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
        int highestQuestionId = -1;
        double highestAnswerRate = 0.0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < questions.size(); i++) {
            int views = questions[i][0];
            int answers = questions[i][1];
            double answerRate = (double) answers / views;
            
            if (answerRate > highestAnswerRate) {
                highestAnswerRate = answerRate;
                highestQuestionId = i;
            }
        }
        
        return highestQuestionId;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def getHighestAnswerRateQuestion(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        highest_question_id = -1
        highest_answer_rate = 0.0
        
        for i in range(len(questions)):
            views = questions[i][0]
            answers = questions[i][1]
            answer_rate = answers / views if views > 0 else 0.0
            
            if answer_rate > highest_answer_rate:
                highest_answer_rate = answer_rate
                highest_question_id = i
                
        return highest_question_id
```
