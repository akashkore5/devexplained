## Explanation:

To find the cumulative salary of an employee, we can treat the salary as a directed graph where each employee is a node and the salary is the weight of the edge from the employee's manager to the employee. We can perform a Depth First Search (DFS) starting from the given employee id to calculate the cumulative salary by summing up the salaries of all employees in the subtree rooted at the given employee.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a map to store the salary of each employee.
2. Create a map to store the direct reports of each employee.
3. Perform a DFS starting from the given employee id:
   - For each employee, add their salary to the cumulative salary.
   - Recursively call the DFS on each direct report of the current employee.
4. Return the cumulative salary.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the total number of employees.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N) for the salary map and direct reports map.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        Map<Integer, Employee> employeeMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            employeeMap.put(emp.id, emp);
        }
        return getImportanceDFS(employeeMap, id);
    }
    
    private int getImportanceDFS(Map<Integer, Employee> employeeMap, int id) {
        Employee employee = employeeMap.get(id);
        int totalSalary = employee.importance;
        for (int subordinateId : employee.subordinates) {
            totalSalary += getImportanceDFS(employeeMap, subordinateId);
        }
        return totalSalary;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> employeeMap;
        for (Employee* emp : employees) {
            employeeMap[emp->id] = emp;
        }
        return getImportanceDFS(employeeMap, id);
    }
    
    int getImportanceDFS(unordered_map<int, Employee*>& employeeMap, int id) {
        Employee* employee = employeeMap[id];
        int totalSalary = employee->importance;
        for (int subordinateId : employee->subordinates) {
            totalSalary += getImportanceDFS(employeeMap, subordinateId);
        }
        return totalSalary;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees: List['Employee'], id: int) -> int:
        employee_map = {emp.id: emp for emp in employees}
        return self.getImportanceDFS(employee_map, id)
    
    def getImportanceDFS(self, employee_map, id):
        employee = employee_map[id]
        total_salary = employee.importance
        for subordinate_id in employee.subordinates:
            total_salary += self.getImportanceDFS(employee_map, subordinate_id)
        return total_salary
```
