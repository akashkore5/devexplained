## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to count the number of students in each department. We can achieve this by iterating through the given list of students and maintaining a HashMap to store the count of students in each department. After iterating through the list, we can then print or return the count of students in each department.

### Algorithmic Idea:
1. Create a HashMap to store the count of students in each department.
2. Iterate through the list of students and update the count of students in the respective department in the HashMap.
3. Print or return the count of students in each department from the HashMap.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of students.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(d), where d is the number of departments.

:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public Map<String, Integer> countStudents(List<String> students) {
        Map<String, Integer> departmentCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String student : students) {
            String[] parts = student.split(",");
            String department = parts[1].trim();
            departmentCount.put(department, departmentCount.getOrDefault(department, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return departmentCount;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> countStudents(std::vector<std::string>& students) {
        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> departmentCount;
        
        for (const std::string& student : students) {
            std::string department = student.substr(student.find(",") + 1);
            departmentCount[department]++;
        }
        
        return departmentCount;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, students: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:
        department_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        for student in students:
            department = student.split(",")[1].strip()
            department_count[department] += 1
        
        return department_count
```
