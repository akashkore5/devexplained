### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query to select the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with id = 2. We can achieve this by using a `LEFT JOIN` to join the Customer table with itself on the `id` and `referee_id` columns, then filtering out the rows where the referee id is 2.

:

#### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
LEFT JOIN Customer AS ref
ON Customer.id = ref.referee_id
WHERE ref.referee_id IS NULL OR ref.referee_id != 2;
```
