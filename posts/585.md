### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find policyholders who have the same total investment value in 2015 (tiv_2015) as one or more other policyholders and are not located in the same city as any other policyholder. We can achieve this by using SQL queries to filter the data based on the given conditions and then summing the total investment value in 2016 (tiv_2016) for the filtered policyholders.

1. Use a SQL query to filter policyholders who have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders.
2. Use another SQL query to filter policyholders who are not located in the same city as any other policyholder.
3. Combine the results of the two queries and calculate the sum of tiv_2016 for the filtered policyholders.

```java
# Write your Java solution here
String sqlQuery = "SELECT SUM(tiv_2016) AS tiv_2016 FROM Insurance WHERE tiv_2015 IN (SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) AND (lat, lon) NOT IN (SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)";
```

#### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
string sqlQuery = "SELECT SUM(tiv_2016) AS tiv_2016 FROM Insurance WHERE tiv_2015 IN (SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) AND (lat, lon) NOT IN (SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)";
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
sql_query = "SELECT SUM(tiv_2016) AS tiv_2016 FROM Insurance WHERE tiv_2015 IN (SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) AND (lat, lon) NOT IN (SELECT lat, lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat, lon HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)"
```
