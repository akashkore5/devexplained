## Explanation
To find the customer who has placed the largest number of orders, we can use a SQL query that groups the orders by customer_number and counts the number of orders for each customer. We then order the result in descending order based on the count and select the customer_number with the highest count.

If there are multiple customers with the same largest number of orders, we can modify the query to include all such customers.

### Algorithm:
1. Group the orders by customer_number and count the number of orders for each customer.
2. Order the result in descending order based on the count.
3. Select the customer_number with the highest count.

Time complexity: O(NlogN) - where N is the number of orders
Space complexity: O(1)
