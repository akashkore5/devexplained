### Explanation
To find the length of the longest harmonious subsequence in an array, we can iterate through the array and count the frequency of each number. For each number, we check if its adjacent number (i.e., number + 1 or number - 1) exists in the frequency map. If it does, we calculate the length of the harmonious subsequence by adding the frequencies of both numbers. We keep track of the maximum length found so far and return it as the result.

- Initialize a map to store the frequency of each number in the array.
- Iterate through the array and populate the frequency map.
- For each number, check if its adjacent number exists in the map and calculate the length of the harmonious subsequence.
- Update the maximum length found so far and return it as the result.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the frequency map.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLen = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        for (int num : freqMap.keySet()) {
            if (freqMap.containsKey(num + 1)) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, freqMap.get(num) + freqMap.get(num + 1));
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        int maxLen = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            freqMap[num]++;
        }

        for (auto & [num, freq] : freqMap) {
            if (freqMap.count(num + 1)) {
                maxLen = max(maxLen, freq + freqMap[num + 1]);
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq_map = collections.Counter(nums)
        max_len = 0

        for num, freq in freq_map.items():
            if num + 1 in freq_map:
                max_len = max(max_len, freq + freq_map[num + 1])

        return max_len
