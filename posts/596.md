### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of students in each class and return only those classes that have at least five students enrolled. In order to do this, we can use a SQL query to group the classes and count the number of students in each class. Then, we filter out the classes with less than five students.
:
```java
# Write your code here
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5;
```

#### C++:
```cpp
# Write your code here
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5;
```

#### Python:
```python
# Write your code here
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5;
```
