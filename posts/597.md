## Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the overall acceptance rate for friend requests. The acceptance rate for a person is defined as the number of accepted friend requests divided by the total number of sent friend requests. The overall acceptance rate is the average acceptance rate of all people.

We will iterate through the input arrays to calculate the acceptance rate for each person and then compute the average acceptance rate.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize variables `totalAccepted` and `totalRequests` to store the total number of accepted friend requests and total number of sent friend requests respectively.
2. Iterate through the input arrays:
   - For each person, calculate the acceptance rate by dividing the number of accepted requests by the number of sent requests.
   - Add the number of accepted requests to `totalAccepted` and the number of sent requests to `totalRequests`.
3. Calculate the overall acceptance rate by dividing `totalAccepted` by `totalRequests`.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of elements in the input arrays.
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public double overallAcceptanceRate(int[] ids, int[] senders, int[] accepters) {
        int totalAccepted = 0;
        int totalRequests = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
            if (senders[i] != accepters[i]) {
                totalRequests++;
            }
            if (ids[i] == accepters[i]) {
                totalAccepted++;
            }
        }
        
        return totalAccepted / (double) totalRequests;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double overallAcceptanceRate(vector<int>& ids, vector<int>& senders, vector<int>& accepters) {
        int totalAccepted = 0;
        int totalRequests = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < ids.size(); i++) {
            if (senders[i] != accepters[i]) {
                totalRequests++;
            }
            if (ids[i] == accepters[i]) {
                totalAccepted++;
            }
        }
        
        return static_cast<double>(totalAccepted) / totalRequests;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def overallAcceptanceRate(self, ids: List[int], senders: List[int], accepters: List[int]) -> float:
        totalAccepted = 0
        totalRequests = 0
        
        for i in range(len(ids)):
            if senders[i] != accepters[i]:
                totalRequests += 1
            if ids[i] == accepters[i]:
                totalAccepted += 1
                
        return totalAccepted / totalRequests
```
