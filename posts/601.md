### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a window of size 3 to check for consecutive ids with people greater than or equal to 100. We will iterate through the Stadium table while maintaining a window of 3 rows. If the current row satisfies the condition, we add it to the result. We need to consider the case where the ids are not consecutive, so we keep track of the current row and the count of consecutive rows meeting the criteria. 

- Start with an empty result set.
- Initialize variables to track current row, consecutive count, and id of the previous row.
- Iterate through the Stadium table.
- Check if the current row meets the condition. If yes, update the consecutive count and add the row to the result.
- If the current row does not meet the condition, reset the consecutive count.
- Return the result ordered by visit_date.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of rows in the Stadium table.
Space complexity: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
