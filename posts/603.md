## Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the reserved seats and track the available seats between each reserved seat. We can then calculate the maximum number of consecutive available seats in each row.

1. Sort the reserved seats by row and seat number.
2. For each row, calculate the number of consecutive available seats between reserved seats.
3. Update the maximum consecutive available seats seen so far.

Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of reserved seats. Sorting the reserved seats takes O(nlogn) time.
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the reserved seats.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, int[][] reservedSeats) {
        Arrays.sort(reservedSeats, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        int maxConsecutiveSeats = 2 * n;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> rowMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int[] seat : reservedSeats) {
            int row = seat[0];
            int seatNum = seat[1];
            
            int mask = (1 << (seatNum - 1));
            rowMap.put(row, rowMap.getOrDefault(row, 0) | mask);
        }
        
        for (int row : rowMap.keySet()) {
            int occupied = rowMap.get(row);
            int consecutiveSeats = 0;
            
            if ((occupied & 30) == 0) {
                consecutiveSeats = 2;
            } else if ((occupied & 120) == 0 || (occupied & 480) == 0 || (occupied & 1920) == 0) {
                consecutiveSeats = 1;
            }
            
            maxConsecutiveSeats -= consecutiveSeats;
        }
        
        return maxConsecutiveSeats;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, vector<vector<int>>& reservedSeats) {
        sort(reservedSeats.begin(), reservedSeats.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] < b[0] || (a[0] == b[0] && a[1] < b[1]);
        });
        
        int maxConsecutiveSeats = 2 * n;
        unordered_map<int, int> rowMap;
        
        for (const auto& seat : reservedSeats) {
            int row = seat[0];
            int seatNum = seat[1];
            
            rowMap[row] |= (1 << (seatNum - 1));
        }
        
        for (const auto& entry : rowMap) {
            int occupied = entry.second;
            int consecutiveSeats = 0;
            
            if ((occupied & 30) == 0) {
                consecutiveSeats = 2;
            } else if ((occupied & 120) == 0 || (occupied & 480) == 0 || (occupied & 1920) == 0) {
                consecutiveSeats = 1;
            }
            
            maxConsecutiveSeats -= consecutiveSeats;
        }
        
        return maxConsecutiveSeats;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfFamilies(self, n: int, reservedSeats: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        reservedSeats.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        maxConsecutiveSeats = 2 * n
        rowMap = {}
        
        for seat in reservedSeats:
            row = seat[0]
            seatNum = seat[1]
            
            rowMap[row] = rowMap.get(row, 0) | (1 << (seatNum - 1))
        
        for row, occupied in rowMap.items():
            consecutiveSeats = 0
            
            if (occupied & 30) == 0:
                consecutiveSeats = 2
            elif (occupied & 120) == 0 or (occupied & 480) == 0 or (occupied & 1920) == 0:
                consecutiveSeats = 1
            
            maxConsecutiveSeats -= consecutiveSeats
        
        return maxConsecutiveSeats
