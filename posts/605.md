### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the flowerbed array and check if we can plant a flower at a particular position by considering the current position, the previous position, and the next position. If all these positions are empty (0), we can plant a flower at the current position. We update the count of planted flowers and continue checking for the next positions until we reach the end of the flowerbed or we have planted enough flowers. Finally, we compare the count of planted flowers with the required number of flowers to be planted and return true if the count is greater than or equal to n.

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the flowerbed array.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we are using constant extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < flowerbed.length) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && (i == flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return count >= n;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < flowerbed.size()) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) && (i == flowerbed.size() - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return count >= n;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(flowerbed):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed) - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                count += 1
            i += 1
        return count >= n
```
