### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the names of all salespersons who did not have any orders related to the company with the name "RED". We can achieve this by using a SQL query that performs a left join between the SalesPerson table and the Orders table, filtering out the salespersons who have orders related to the company "RED".

:

```java
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
LEFT JOIN Orders ON SalesPerson.sales_id = Orders.sales_id
LEFT JOIN Company ON Orders.com_id = Company.com_id
WHERE Company.name != 'RED' OR Company.name IS NULL
```

```cpp
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
LEFT JOIN Orders ON SalesPerson.sales_id = Orders.sales_id
LEFT JOIN Company ON Orders.com_id = Company.com_id
WHERE Company.name != 'RED' OR Company.name IS NULL;
```

```python
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
LEFT JOIN Orders ON SalesPerson.sales_id = Orders.sales_id
LEFT JOIN Company ON Orders.com_id = Company.com_id
WHERE Company.name != 'RED' OR Company.name IS NULL;
```
