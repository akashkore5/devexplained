### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a SQL query to determine the type of each node in the tree based on whether the node is a root, an inner node, or a leaf node.

1. For each node in the tree, we can check if it is a root node by verifying if its parent id is null.
2. If a node is not a root node, we can check if it is an inner node by verifying if it has a parent node and at least one child node.
3. If a node is neither a root nor an inner node, then it must be a leaf node.

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT id,
    CASE
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree
```

#### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT id,
    CASE
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree;
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT id,
    CASE
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN id IN (SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS type
FROM Tree
```
