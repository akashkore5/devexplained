### Explanation:
To determine if three line segments can form a triangle, we need to check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. If this condition holds true for all three pairs of sides, then the segments can form a triangle.

```java
# Write your Java solution here
SELECT x, y, z,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN "Yes"
        ELSE "No"
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

#### C++
```cpp
# Write your C++ solution here
SELECT x, y, z,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN "Yes"
        ELSE "No"
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
SELECT x, y, z,
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN "Yes"
        ELSE "No"
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```
