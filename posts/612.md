## Explanation:
To find the shortest distance in a plane between two points given as arrays of points, we can calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points and find the minimum distance.

1. Iterate through all pairs of points and calculate the Euclidean distance using the formula:  
   $distance = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}$
   
2. Keep track of the minimum distance found so far.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of points given.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public double shortestDistance(int[][] points) {
        double minDistance = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
                double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(points[j][0] - points[i][0], 2) + Math.pow(points[j][1] - points[i][1], 2));
                minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, distance);
            }
        }
        
        return minDistance;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double shortestDistance(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        double minDistance = DBL_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
                double distance = sqrt(pow(points[j][0] - points[i][0], 2) + pow(points[j][1] - points[i][1], 2));
                minDistance = min(minDistance, distance);
            }
        }
        
        return minDistance;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> float:
        min_distance = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(len(points)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
                distance = ((points[j][0] - points[i][0])**2 + (points[j][1] - points[i][1])**2)**0.5
                min_distance = min(min_distance, distance)
        
        return min_distance
```
