### Explanation:

Given a set of points on a straight line and an integer *k*, we need to find the shortest distance between any two points among the first *k* points.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `minDist` to store the minimum distance. Set it to maximum possible value initially.
2. Iterate over all pairs of points among the first *k* points.
3. Calculate the distance between each pair of points and update `minDist` if the calculated distance is smaller.
4. Finally, return `minDist` as the shortest distance.

**Time Complexity:**  
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(k^2) as we are iterating over all pairs of points among the first *k* points.

**Space Complexity:**  
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(int[] points, int k) {
        int minDist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++) {
                int dist = Math.abs(points[j] - points[i]);
                minDist = Math.min(minDist, dist);
            }
        }
        return minDist;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<int>& points, int k) {
        int minDist = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++) {
                int dist = abs(points[j] - points[i]);
                minDist = min(minDist, dist);
            }
        }
        return minDist;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, points: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        minDist = float('inf')
        for i in range(k - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, k):
                dist = abs(points[j] - points[i])
                minDist = min(minDist, dist)
        return minDist
```
