### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a combination of SQL queries to calculate the average salary of each department and compare it with the average salary of the whole company. We can achieve this by first calculating the average salary per department and then joining this information to calculate the average salary for the entire company. Finally, we can compare the two averages to determine which departments have a higher average salary than the company as a whole.

:

```java
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT department_id,
       MAX(CASE WHEN department_id IS NOT NULL THEN AVG(salary) ELSE NULL END) AS department_average,
       (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salary) AS company_average
FROM salary
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING department_average > company_average OR department_average IS NULL AND company_average IS NOT NULL;
```

```cpp
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT department_id,
       MAX(CASE WHEN department_id IS NOT NULL THEN AVG(salary) ELSE NULL END) AS department_average,
       (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salary) AS company_average
FROM salary
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING department_average > company_average OR department_average IS NULL AND company_average IS NOT NULL;
```

```python
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT department_id,
       MAX(CASE WHEN department_id IS NOT NULL THEN AVG(salary) ELSE NULL END) AS department_average,
       (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salary) AS company_average
FROM salary
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING department_average > company_average OR department_average IS NULL AND company_average IS NOT NULL;
