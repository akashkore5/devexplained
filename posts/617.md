## Explanation
To merge two binary trees, we need to traverse both trees simultaneously. At each step, we check if the current nodes in both trees are not null. If both nodes are not null, we update the value of the node in the first tree by adding the value of the corresponding node in the second tree. If one of the nodes is null, we take the non-null node as the merged node. If both nodes are null, the merged node will also be null. We then recursively merge the left subtree and right subtree of both trees.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of nodes in the smaller tree
Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursive call stack
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if (root1 == null) {
            return root2;
        }
        if (root2 == null) {
            return root1;
        }
        
        root1.val += root2.val;
        root1.left = mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left);
        root1.right = mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right);
        
        return root1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        if (root1 == nullptr) {
            return root2;
        }
        if (root2 == nullptr) {
            return root1;
        }
        
        root1->val += root2->val;
        root1->left = mergeTrees(root1->left, root2->left);
        root1->right = mergeTrees(root1->right, root2->right);
        
        return root1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root1:
            return root2
        if not root2:
            return root1
        
        root1.val += root2.val
        root1.left = self.mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left)
        root1.right = self.mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right)
        
        return root1
```
