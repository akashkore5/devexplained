## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. We can start by sorting the given list of student scores. Then, for each query, we can perform a binary search to find the number of students with scores between the given range.

Here are the steps:
1. Sort the list of student scores in ascending order.
2. For each query, use binary search to find the index of the first student with a score greater than or equal to the lower bound, and the index of the last student with a score less than or equal to the upper bound.
3. Calculate the number of students within the range by subtracting the indexes found in step 2 and adding 1.

Time complexity analysis:
- Sorting the list of student scores takes O(nlogn) time.
- Processing each query using binary search takes O(logn) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(nlogn + qlogn), where n is the number of students and q is the number of queries.

Space complexity:
- We only need a constant amount of extra space for variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> countStudents(int[] heights, int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(heights);
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] p : people) {
            int low = 0, high = heights.length - 1;
            int start = -1, end = -1;
            
            while (low <= high) {
                int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
                if (heights[mid] >= p[0]) {
                    start = mid;
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            
            low = 0;
            high = heights.length - 1;
            
            while (low <= high) {
                int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
                if (heights[mid] <= p[1]) {
                    end = mid;
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
            
            result.add(end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countStudents(vector<int>& heights, vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(heights.begin(), heights.end());
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (auto& p : people) {
            int start = lower_bound(heights.begin(), heights.end(), p[0]) - heights.begin();
            int end = upper_bound(heights.begin(), heights.end(), p[1]) - heights.begin() - 1;
            
            result.push_back(end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, heights: List[int], people: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        heights.sort()
        result = []
        
        for p in people:
            start = bisect_left(heights, p[0])
            end = bisect_right(heights, p[1]) - 1
            
            result.append(end - start + 1)
        
        return result
```
