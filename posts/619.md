### Explanation
To find the largest single number in the given table, we need to identify numbers that appear only once. We can achieve this by counting the frequency of each number in the table. Once we have the frequency count, we can iterate through the table again to find the largest single number. If no single numbers are found, we return null.

- Create a map to store the frequency of each number.
- Iterate through the table to count the frequency of each number.
- Iterate through the table again to find the largest single number.
- Return the largest single number or null if no single numbers are found.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of rows in the table.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the frequency map.
