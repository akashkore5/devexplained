### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid. The number of unique paths to reach a cell is the sum of the number of paths to reach the cell above it and the cell to the left of it.

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

2. Initialize the first row and first column of `dp` with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column.

3. Iterate through the grid starting from `(1, 1)` and update `dp[i][j]` as `dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`.

4. Return `dp[m-1][n-1]` which represents the number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right corner.

- Time complexity: O(m x n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
- Space complexity: O(m x n) for the 2D array `dp`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```
