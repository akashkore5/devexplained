### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can write a SQL query to select movies with odd-numbered IDs and descriptions that are not "boring". We can order the result by rating in descending order.

:

```java
# Write your SQL query here
SELECT * 
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 != 0 AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

```cpp
# Write your SQL query here
SELECT * 
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 != 0 AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

```python
# Write your SQL query here
SELECT * 
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 != 0 AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
