### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a simple SQL query that swaps the seat id of every two consecutive students. We can achieve this by joining the `Seat` table with itself, using a self-join operation, where we match the odd seat id with the next even seat id. We then select the desired columns in the required order and sort by the seat id in ascending order.

**Algorithm:**
1. Perform a self-join on the `Seat` table to match odd seat ids with the next even seat ids.
2. Select the columns `id` and `student` in the desired order.
3. Order the result by `id` in ascending order.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of students.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) constant space required for the SQL query execution.

```java
# Write your Java solution here
String sqlQuery = "SELECT CASE WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id != (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1 "
                + "WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1 ELSE id END AS id, student FROM Seat ORDER BY id;";
```

#### C++
```cpp
// Write your C++ solution here
string sqlQuery = "SELECT CASE WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id != (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1 "
                "WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1 ELSE id END AS id, student FROM Seat ORDER BY id;";
```

#### Python
```python
# Write your Python solution here
sqlQuery = "SELECT CASE WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id != (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1 " \
            "WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1 ELSE id END AS id, student FROM Seat ORDER BY id;"
```
