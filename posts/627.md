### Explanation:
To swap the values in the 'sex' column from 'f' to 'm' and vice versa, we can use a single update statement with a CASE statement in SQL. We can update the 'sex' column based on its current value - changing 'f' to 'm' and 'm' to 'f' in the process. This solution does not require any intermediate temporary tables.

:

```java
# Write your Java solution here
String sqlQuery = "UPDATE Salary SET sex = CASE WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm' ELSE 'f' END";
```

```cpp
// Write your C++ solution here
string sqlQuery = "UPDATE Salary SET sex = CASE WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm' ELSE 'f' END";
```

```python
# Write your Python solution here
sql_query = "UPDATE Salary SET sex = CASE WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm' ELSE 'f' END"
```
