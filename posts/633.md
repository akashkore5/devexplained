## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We initialize two pointers, `left` at 0 and `right` at the square root of `c`. At each step, we calculate the sum of the squares of the values at these pointers. If the sum is equal to `c`, we return true. If the sum is less than `c`, we increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum, and if the sum is greater than `c`, we decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum. We continue this process until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

Time complexity: O(sqrt(c))
Space complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        int left = 0, right = (int)Math.sqrt(c);
        while (left <= right) {
            int sum = left*left + right*right;
            if (sum == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < c) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        int left = 0, right = sqrt(c);
        while (left <= right) {
            int sum = left*left + right*right;
            if (sum == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < c) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        left, right = 0, int(c**0.5)
        while left <= right:
            total = left**2 + right**2
            if total == c:
                return True
            elif total < c:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return False
```
