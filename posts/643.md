### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window technique. We will initially calculate the sum of the first `k` elements in the array. Then, we will slide the window to the right by adding the next element and removing the leftmost element from the window. We will keep track of the maximum average we have seen so far. By updating the sum and recalculating the average at each step, we can find the maximum average subarray of length `k`.

- Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the first `k` elements.
- Iterate through the array from index `k` to the end.
- At each step, update the sum by adding the current element and subtracting the element `k` steps back.
- Calculate the average by dividing the sum by `k` and update the maximum average if needed.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public double findMaxAverage(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        double maxAverage = (double) sum / k;

        for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            maxAverage = Math.max(maxAverage, (double) sum / k);
        }

        return maxAverage;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        double maxAverage = (double)sum / k;

        for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            maxAverage = max(maxAverage, (double)sum / k);
        }

        return maxAverage;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        _sum = sum(nums[:k])
        max_average = _sum / k

        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            _sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            max_average = max(max_average, _sum / k)

        return max_average
```
