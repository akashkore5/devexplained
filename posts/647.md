## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string s and treat it as the center of a palindrome. We expand outwards from each center to check for palindromic substrings. There are two cases to consider:
1. Palindromes with single center (e.g., "aba")
2. Palindromes with double center (e.g., "abba")

By considering both cases, we can count all palindromic substrings in the given string.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a count variable to store the total count of palindromic substrings.
2. Iterate through each character in the string s:
    a. For each character, consider it as the center of a palindrome and expand outwards to count palindromes with a single center.
    b. Also, consider this character and its right neighbor as the double center of a palindrome and expand outwards to count palindromes with a double center.
3. Return the total count of palindromic substrings.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we expand around each character in the string to find palindromic substrings.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.
```java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            count += countPalindromes(s, i, i); // single center palindromes
            count += countPalindromes(s, i, i + 1); // double center palindromes
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private int countPalindromes(String s, int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            count++;
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            count += countPalindromes(s, i, i); // single center palindromes
            count += countPalindromes(s, i, i + 1); // double center palindromes
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    int countPalindromes(string s, int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s[left] == s[right]) {
            count++;
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            count += self.countPalindromes(s, i, i) # single center palindromes
            count += self.countPalindromes(s, i, i+1) # double center palindromes
        return count
    
    def countPalindromes(self, s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return count
```
