### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We maintain a dp array where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations to get 'A' exactly i times on the screen. At each step, we can either copy all characters (which increments the number of characters by the current number of characters on the screen) or paste the characters (which increments the number of characters by the characters copied in the previous step). We iterate from 2 to n and update dp[i] based on the minimum of dp[i/2] + 2 (copy all and paste) or dp[j] + i/j (copy j characters and paste i/j times).

- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(n)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for (int j = i / 2; j >= 2; j--) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + i / j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for (int j = i / 2; j >= 2; j--) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + i / j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = i
            for j in range(i // 2, 1, -1):
                if i % j == 0:
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + i // j
                    break
        return dp[n]
```
