## Explanation:

This problem asks us to find the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed on the screen using the following operations:
1. 'A': Print one 'A' on the screen.
2. Ctrl-A: Select the whole screen.
3. Ctrl-C: Copy the selected text to the buffer.
4. Ctrl-V: Print the content of the buffer on the screen.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can maintain a dp array where dp[i] represents the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed with i keystrokes. At each step, we can either press 'A' or use Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, and Ctrl-V. We can iterate through the possible number of keystrokes and calculate the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize a dp array of size n+1 to store the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed with i keystrokes.
2. Iterate from i=1 to n and for each i:
   - Initialize dp[i] = i (press 'A' i times).
   - Iterate j from i-3 down to 1 (to consider the Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V operations):
     - Update dp[i] to max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i-j-1)).

The final result will be stored in dp[n], which represents the maximum number of 'A's that can be printed with n keystrokes.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the given number of keystrokes.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n) to store the dp array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxA(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for (int j = i - 3; j >= 1; j--) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1));
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxA(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = i;
            for (int j = i - 3; j >= 1; j--) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1));
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxA(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i] = i
            for j in range(i - 3, 0, -1):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * (i - j - 1))
        return dp[n]
```
