### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can keep track of the robot's position by incrementing or decrementing its x-coordinate for 'R' and 'L' moves respectively, and its y-coordinate for 'U' and 'D' moves respectively. After processing all the moves, if the robot's final position is back at the origin (0, 0), we return true; otherwise, we return false.

- Initialize variables for x and y coordinates.
- Iterate through the moves string, updating the coordinates based on the current move.
- Check if the final position is at the origin.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the moves string.
Space Complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        for (char move : moves.toCharArray()) {
            if (move == 'U') y++;
            else if (move == 'D') y--;
            else if (move == 'L') x--;
            else if (move == 'R') x++;
        }
        return x == 0 && y == 0;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        for (char move : moves) {
            if (move == 'U') y++;
            else if (move == 'D') y--;
            else if (move == 'L') x--;
            else if (move == 'R') x++;
        }
        return x == 0 && y == 0;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        x, y = 0, 0
        for move in moves:
            if move == 'U':
                y += 1
            elif move == 'D':
                y -= 1
            elif move == 'L':
                x -= 1
            elif move == 'R':
                x += 1
        return x == 0 and y == 0
