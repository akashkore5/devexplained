## Explanation:
This problem asks us to remove all occurrences of the digit 9 from the numbers starting from 1 and concatenate them in increasing order. We need to return the `n-th` integer after removing all occurrences of the digit 9.

To solve the problem, we can use a base-9 number system. By representing the numbers in base-9 and mapping the digit 9 to 10, we can easily calculate the `n-th` number without having to generate all numbers up to `n`.

### Algorithmic Steps:
1. Convert the input `n` to base-9 representation by mapping digit 9 to 10.
2. Calculate the `n-th` number in base-9 representation.
3. Convert the `n-th` number back to decimal representation.

Time Complexity: O(log(n))  
Space Complexity: O(1)

:
```java
class Solution {
    public int newInteger(int n) {
        return Integer.parseInt(Integer.toString(n, 9));
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int newInteger(int n) {
        return stoi(to_string(n), 0, 9);
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def newInteger(self, n: int) -> int:
        return int(str(n), 9)
```
