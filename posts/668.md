### Explanation:
To find the kth smallest number in the multiplication table, we can perform a binary search on the range of possible values. The key observation is that the numbers in the multiplication table are sorted row-wise and column-wise. We can use binary search to find the smallest number x such that there are exactly k numbers in the table that are less than or equal to x.

1. Initialize the range of possible values from 1 to m * n.
2. Perform a binary search on this range.
3. For each mid value, count the number of elements in the table that are less than or equal to mid by iterating through each row and finding the number of elements less than or equal to mid in that row.
4. Update the search range based on the count of elements less than or equal to mid.

Time Complexity: O(m * log(m*n))
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int lo = 1, hi = m * n;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
                count += Math.min(mid / i, n);
            }
            if (count < k) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int lo = 1, hi = m * n;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
                count += min(mid / i, n);
            }
            if (count < k) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthNumber(self, m: int, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        lo, hi = 1, m * n
        while lo < hi:
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2
            count = 0
            for i in range(1, m + 1):
                count += min(mid // i, n)
            if count < k:
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid
        return lo
