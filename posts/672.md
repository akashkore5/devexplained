## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to observe the pattern of bulb status changes based on the button presses. We can identify that different combinations of button presses will lead to different statuses of the bulbs. By analyzing the effects of each button press, we can determine the number of distinct statuses that can be achieved.

We can represent the bulb status changes using a matrix where each row represents the bulb labels and each column represents the button presses. By iterating through the matrix, we can keep track of the unique statuses that can be achieved after the specified number of button presses.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of bulbs, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int flipLights(int n, int presses) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 2;
        if (n == 2) return presses == 1 ? 3 : 4;
        if (presses == 1) return n == 3 ? 4 : 7;
        if (presses == 2) return n == 3 ? 8 : 8;
        return n == 3 ? 8 : 16;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int flipLights(int n, int presses) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 2;
        if (n == 2) return presses == 1 ? 3 : 4;
        if (presses == 1) return n == 3 ? 4 : 7;
        if (presses == 2) return n == 3 ? 8 : 8;
        return n == 3 ? 8 : 16;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def flipLights(self, n: int, presses: int) -> int:
        if n == 0: return 1
        if n == 1: return 2
        if n == 2: return 3 if presses == 1 else 4
        if presses == 1: return 4 if n == 3 else 7
        if presses == 2: return 8 if n == 3 else 8
        return 8 if n == 3 else 16
```
