## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Find all tree positions along with their heights and sort them based on height.
2. For each pair of adjacent trees, find the shortest path using BFS.
3. Add up the distances obtained from each pair traversal to get the final answer.

Time complexity: O((mn)^2)
Space complexity: O(mn)
```java
// Java code
class Solution {
    public int cutOffTree(List<List<Integer>> forest) {
        // Java solution code here
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
// C++ code
class Solution {
public:
    int cutOffTree(vector<vector<int>>& forest) {
        // C++ solution code here
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
# Python code
class Solution:
    def cutOffTree(self, forest: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Python solution code here
