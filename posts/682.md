### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the record of scores. We iterate through each operation in the input list and perform the corresponding action. If the operation is to add a new score, we push it onto the stack. If the operation is to add the sum of previous two scores, we pop the last two scores, calculate their sum, and push it back onto the stack. If the operation is to double the previous score, we double the last score and push it back onto the stack. If the operation is to invalidate the previous score, we pop the last score from the stack. Finally, we sum up all the scores remaining in the stack to get the total sum.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of operations in the input list.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(n) where n is the number of operations in the input list.
