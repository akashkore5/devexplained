### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a 3D array to keep track of the probabilities of the knight being on the board at each cell after each move. We will iteratively calculate the probabilities for each cell after every move until reaching the kth move. Finally, we sum up the probabilities of all cells that are still on the board. 

1. Initialize a 3D array `dp` of size `(n x n x k+1)` where `dp[i][j][step]` represents the probability of the knight being at cell `(i, j)` after `step` moves.
2. For the base case where `step = 0`, set `dp[row][col][0] = 1` as the knight is already at the starting position.
3. For each step from 1 to k, iterate over all cells and calculate the probabilities based on the previous step's probabilities and the knight's possible moves.
4. The knight can move to 8 different positions from a cell, with each move having a probability of `1/8`. If the move is within the board, update the probability for the new position.
5. After k moves, sum up the probabilities of all cells that are still on the board to get the final result.

Time Complexity: O(n^2 * k)  
Space Complexity: O(n^2 * k)
