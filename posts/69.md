### Explanation

To find the square root of a non-negative integer `x` without using any built-in exponent function or operator, we can use binary search. We start with a range `[0, x]` and iteratively narrow down the range until we find the square root. At each iteration, we calculate the mid-point of the current range and check if the square of the mid-point is greater, equal to, or less than `x`. Based on this comparison, we update the range to search in. We continue this process until we find the integer square root.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `x`.
  2. While `left <= right`, calculate the mid-point `mid` as `(left + right) / 2`.
  3. If `mid * mid == x`, return `mid`.
  4. If `mid * mid < x`, update `left` to `mid + 1`.
  5. If `mid * mid > x`, update `right` to `mid - 1`.
  6. Return `right` as the integer square root of `x`.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(x)) - Binary search reduces the search range by half in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space is used.
```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        long left = 1, right = x;
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid * mid == x) return (int)mid;
            else if (mid * mid < x) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return (int)right - 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        long left = 1, right = x;
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid * mid == x) return mid;
            else if (mid * mid < x) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return right - 1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        left, right = 1, x
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid < x:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return right - 1
```
