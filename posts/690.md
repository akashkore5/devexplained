### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the employee hierarchy starting from the given employee ID. We will keep track of the total importance value by summing up the importance values of the current employee and recursively calling the function for each of its direct subordinates.

### Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap to store the employee objects indexed by their IDs for easy access.
2. Define a recursive function `getTotalImportance` that takes an employee ID as input and returns the total importance value.
3. In the function:
   - Get the employee object using the given ID.
   - Add the importance value of the current employee to the total importance.
   - Recursively call the function for each direct subordinate and add their importance values.
   - Return the total importance value.
4. Call the function with the given employee ID to get the result.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the total number of employees in the input list.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also O(N) due to the hashmap used to store employee objects.

:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    public int id;
    public int importance;
    public List<Integer> subordinates;
}

class Solution {
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (Employee e : employees) {
            map.put(e.id, e);
        }
        return getTotalImportance(map, id);
    }

    private int getTotalImportance(Map<Integer, Employee> map, int id) {
        Employee employee = map.get(id);
        int totalImportance = employee.importance;
        for (int subId : employee.subordinates) {
            totalImportance += getTotalImportance(map, subId);
        }
        return totalImportance;
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Employee {
public:
    int id;
    int importance;
    vector<int> subordinates;
};

class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> map;
        for (auto emp : employees) {
            map[emp->id] = emp;
        }
        return getTotalImportance(map, id);
    }

    int getTotalImportance(unordered_map<int, Employee*>& map, int id) {
        Employee* employee = map[id];
        int totalImportance = employee->importance;
        for (int subId : employee->subordinates) {
            totalImportance += getTotalImportance(map, subId);
        }
        return totalImportance;
    }
};
```

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id, importance, subordinates):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.subordinates = subordinates

class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees, id):
        employee_map = {emp.id: emp for emp in employees}
        
        def get_total_importance(emp_id):
            employee = employee_map[emp_id]
            total_importance = employee.importance
            for sub_id in employee.subordinates:
                total_importance += get_total_importance(sub_id)
            return total_importance
        
        return get_total_importance(id)
