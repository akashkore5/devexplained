### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the frequency of each word in the input array. Then, we can use a priority queue (min heap) to keep track of the k most frequent words based on their frequency and lexicographical order. We will iterate through the hashmap and maintain the k most frequent words in the priority queue. If the size of the priority queue exceeds k, we will remove the least frequent word. Finally, we will extract the words from the priority queue in reverse order to get the k most frequent words sorted by frequency and lexicographical order.

#### Algorithm:
1. Create a hashmap to store the frequency of each word.
2. Iterate through the input array and update the frequency in the hashmap.
3. Create a priority queue (min heap) based on the custom comparator to compare words by frequency and lexicographical order.
4. Iterate through the hashmap and add words to the priority queue.
5. If the size of the priority queue exceeds k, remove the least frequent word.
6. Extract the words from the priority queue in reverse order to get the k most frequent words.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log(k)), where n is the number of words in the input array.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(n) for the hashmap and priority queue.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        Map<String, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            freqMap.put(word, freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<String> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> freqMap.get(a).equals(freqMap.get(b)) ? b.compareTo(a) : freqMap.get(a) - freqMap.get(b)
        );
        
        for (String word : freqMap.keySet()) {
            pq.offer(word);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            result.add(0, pq.poll());
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {
        unordered_map<string, int> freqMap;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            freqMap[word]++;
        }
        
        auto cmp = [&](const string& a, const string& b) {
            return freqMap[a] == freqMap[b] ? a > b : freqMap[a] < freqMap[b];
        };
        
        priority_queue<string, vector<string>, decltype(cmp)> pq(cmp);
        
        for (const auto& entry : freqMap) {
            pq.push(entry.first);
            if (pq.size() > k) {
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        
        vector<string> result;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            result.insert(result.begin(), pq.top());
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        freq_map = Counter(words)
        pq = []
        
        for word, freq in freq_map.items():
            heapq.heappush(pq, (-freq, word))
        
        result = []
        for _ in range(k):
            result.append(heapq.heappop(pq)[1])
        
        return result
```
