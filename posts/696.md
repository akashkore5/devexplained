## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the binary string `s` and count the number of consecutive 0's and 1's. For each index `i`, we can find the number of consecutive 0's and 1's starting from that index. The number of valid substrings formed at index `i` will be the minimum of the counts of consecutive 0's and 1's starting from that index. We can then sum up the counts for all indices to get the total number of valid substrings.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize variables `prevCount`, `currCount`, `totalCount` to 0.
2. Iterate through the binary string `s`:
     - If the current character is different from the previous character, update `prevCount` to `currCount` and reset `currCount` to 1.
     - If the current character is the same as the previous character, increment `currCount`.
     - If `prevCount >= currCount`, increment `totalCount`.
3. Return `totalCount` as the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
        int prevCount = 0, currCount = 1, totalCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                prevCount = currCount;
                currCount = 1;
            } else {
                currCount++;
            }
            if (prevCount >= currCount) {
                totalCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return totalCount;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countBinarySubstrings(string s) {
        int prevCount = 0, currCount = 1, totalCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
                prevCount = currCount;
                currCount = 1;
            } else {
                currCount++;
            }
            if (prevCount >= currCount) {
                totalCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return totalCount;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        prevCount, currCount, totalCount = 0, 1, 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
                prevCount = currCount
                currCount = 1
            else:
                currCount += 1
            if prevCount >= currCount:
                totalCount += 1
        
        return totalCount
```
