### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct ways to reach step `i`. We can then build up this array iteratively by considering the number of ways to reach the current step based on the number of ways to reach the previous two steps.

1. Initialize a DP array of size `n+1` to store the number of ways to reach each step.
2. Set `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1` as there is only 1 way to reach the first and second steps.
3. Iterate from `i = 2` up to `n` and calculate `dp[i]` based on the sum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, as you can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
4. Return `dp[n]` as the final answer.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return 1
        
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
        
        return dp[n]
```
