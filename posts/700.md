### Explanation
To solve this problem, we will perform a simple binary search on the BST. Starting from the root node, we will compare the value with the given target value. If the current node's value is equal to the target value, we return the current node. If the target value is less than the current node's value, we move to the left subtree. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, we move to the right subtree. We repeat this process until we find the target value or reach a leaf node.

- Algorithm:
  1. Start from the root node.
  2. If the current node is null, return null.
  3. If the current node's value is equal to the target value, return the current node.
  4. If the target value is less than the current node's value, move to the left subtree.
  5. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right subtree.
  6. Repeat steps 2-5 until we find the target value or reach a leaf node.

- Time Complexity: O(log N) on average, where N is the number of nodes in the BST.
- Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using iterative traversal.
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        while (root != null && root.val != val) {
            root = (val < root.val) ? root.left : root.right;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* searchBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        while (root != nullptr && root->val != val) {
            root = (val < root->val) ? root->left : root->right;
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:
        while root is not None and root.val != val:
            root = root.left if val < root.val else root.right
        return root
