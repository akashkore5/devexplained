## Explanation:

Given a sorted array of unknown size and a target value, we need to find if the target exists in the array and return its index. We are not provided with the size of the array. We can approach this problem by using a binary search algorithm with an optimized search space.

1. Start with an index `low = 0` and `high = 1`.
2. Check if the target value lies between the `low` and `high` indices by comparing the target value with the element at index `high`.
3. If the target value is greater than the element at index `high`, update `low = high` and `high = 2 * high` to expand the search space.
4. Perform binary search within the range `[low, high]` to find the target value.

This approach helps in dynamically expanding the search space based on the target value and ensuring that the binary search is performed within a valid range.

Time Complexity: O(log n) - where n is the index of the target element within the array.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(ArrayReader reader, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = 1;
        while (reader.get(high) < target) {
            low = high;
            high *= 2;
        }
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (reader.get(mid) == target)
                return mid;
            else if (reader.get(mid) < target)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(ArrayReader &reader, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = 1;
        while (reader.get(high) < target) {
            low = high;
            high *= 2;
        }
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (reader.get(mid) == target)
                return mid;
            else if (reader.get(mid) < target)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, reader, target):
        low, high = 0, 1
        while reader.get(high) < target:
            low = high
            high *= 2
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            if reader.get(mid) == target:
                return mid
            elif reader.get(mid) < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        return -1
