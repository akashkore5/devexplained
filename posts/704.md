### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the binary search algorithm due to its O(log n) time complexity. The idea is to divide the array into two halves at each step and check if the target element lies in the left half, right half, or is equal to the middle element. By iteratively narrowing down the search range, we can efficiently find the target element or determine that it does not exist in the array.

- Start with the entire array as the search range.
- Calculate the middle index of the current search range.
- Compare the middle element with the target:
  - If the middle element is equal to the target, return the index.
  - If the target is less than the middle element, search in the left half.
  - If the target is greater than the middle element, search in the right half.
- Repeat the above steps until the search range becomes empty.

Time complexity: O(log n)  
Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return -1
```
