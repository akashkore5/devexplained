### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will keep track of two states at each day: 1) the maximum profit we can have if we currently own a stock, and 2) the maximum profit we can have if we currently do not own a stock. 

At each day, we update these two states based on the decisions of whether to buy, sell, or do nothing. We consider the transaction fee when buying or selling stocks.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of days in the prices array. The space complexity is O(1) as we only need constant space to store the two states.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int ownStock = -prices[0];
        int notOwnStock = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int prevOwnStock = ownStock;
            int prevNotOwnStock = notOwnStock;
            
            // Decide whether to buy, sell, or do nothing
            ownStock = Math.max(prevOwnStock, prevNotOwnStock - prices[i]);
            notOwnStock = Math.max(prevNotOwnStock, prevOwnStock + prices[i] - fee);
        }
        
        return notOwnStock;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int ownStock = -prices[0];
        int notOwnStock = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            int prevOwnStock = ownStock;
            int prevNotOwnStock = notOwnStock;
            
            // Decide whether to buy, sell, or do nothing
            ownStock = max(prevOwnStock, prevNotOwnStock - prices[i]);
            notOwnStock = max(prevNotOwnStock, prevOwnStock + prices[i] - fee);
        }
        
        return notOwnStock;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        own_stock = -prices[0]
        not_own_stock = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            prev_own_stock = own_stock
            prev_not_own_stock = not_own_stock
            
            # Decide whether to buy, sell, or do nothing
            own_stock = max(prev_own_stock, prev_not_own_stock - prices[i])
            not_own_stock = max(prev_not_own_stock, prev_own_stock + prices[i] - fee)
        
        return not_own_stock
```
