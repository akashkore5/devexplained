## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a HashSet to store all valid words. We then iterate through the given words array and check if all prefixes of the word exist in the HashSet. If it does, we add the word to the HashSet. Finally, we iterate through the words in the HashSet to find the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty HashSet `wordSet`.
2. Sort the given array of words lexicographically.
3. Iterate through the sorted words array:
   - Check if all prefixes of the word exist in `wordSet`.
   - If they do, add the word to `wordSet`.
4. Iterate through the words in `wordSet` to find the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

### Time Complexity:
- Let n be the total number of characters in all words.
- Sorting the array of words takes O(m log m) time, where m is the number of words.
- Iterating through the words array and checking prefixes takes O(n) time.
- Iterating through the HashSet to find the result takes O(m) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m log m).

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) to store the HashSet and sorted array of words.
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestWord(String[] words) {
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>();
        Arrays.sort(words);
        
        String result = "";
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (word.length() == 1 || wordSet.contains(word.substring(0, word.length() - 1))) {
                wordSet.add(word);
                if (word.length() > result.length()) {
                    result = word;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestWord(vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet;
        sort(words.begin(), words.end());
        
        string result = "";
        
        for (const string& word : words) {
            if (word.length() == 1 || wordSet.count(word.substr(0, word.length() - 1))) {
                wordSet.insert(word);
                if (word.length() > result.length()) {
                    result = word;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        wordSet = set()
        words.sort()
        
        result = ""
        
        for word in words:
            if len(word) == 1 or word[:-1] in wordSet:
                wordSet.add(word)
                if len(word) > len(result):
                    result = word
        
        return result
```
