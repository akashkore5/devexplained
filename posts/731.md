## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a similar approach to the "My Calendar I" problem but with an additional helper structure to keep track of double bookings. We will maintain two lists - one for regular bookings and another for double bookings. When booking an event, we will check if it overlaps with any existing double bookings. If it does, we return false. Otherwise, we update the double bookings list accordingly.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize two lists - one for regular bookings and one for double bookings.
2. For each booking request:
   - Check if the booking overlaps with any double bookings. If it does, return false.
   - Check if the booking overlaps with any regular bookings. If it does, add the overlapping interval to the double bookings list.
   - If no overlaps, add the booking to the regular bookings list.
3. If all bookings are successful, return true.

Time Complexity:
- Each booking operation involves iterating over the existing bookings, resulting in O(n) time complexity per booking, where n is the number of existing bookings.

Space Complexity:
- O(n) where n is the number of total bookings.

```java
class MyCalendarTwo {
    List<int[]> calendar;
    List<int[]> overlaps;

    public MyCalendarTwo() {
        calendar = new ArrayList<>();
        overlaps = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] interval : overlaps) {
            if (Math.max(interval[0], start) < Math.min(interval[1], end)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        for (int[] interval : calendar) {
            if (Math.max(interval[0], start) < Math.min(interval[1], end)) {
                overlaps.add(new int[]{Math.max(interval[0], start), Math.min(interval[1], end)});
            }
        }

        calendar.add(new int[]{start, end});
        return true;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class MyCalendarTwo {
    vector<pair<int, int>> calendar;
    vector<pair<int, int>> overlaps;

public:
    MyCalendarTwo() {}

    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for (auto& interval : overlaps) {
            if (max(interval.first, start) < min(interval.second, end)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        for (auto& interval : calendar) {
            if (max(interval.first, start) < min(interval.second, end)) {
                overlaps.push_back({max(interval.first, start), min(interval.second, end)});
            }
        }

        calendar.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }
};
```

```python
class MyCalendarTwo:

    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = []
        self.overlaps = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        for interval in self.overlaps:
            if max(interval[0], start) < min(interval[1], end):
                return False

        for interval in self.calendar:
            if max(interval[0], start) < min(interval[1], end):
                self.overlaps.append([max(interval[0], start), min(interval[1], end)])

        self.calendar.append([start, end])
        return True
```
