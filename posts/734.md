### Explanation:
The problem requires us to determine if two sentences are similar. Two sentences are considered similar if they are either identical or one sentence can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single word.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the words in the two sentences simultaneously. We compare the words at each position in both sentences. If the words are the same, we move to the next position. If the words are different, we check if the remaining words in both sentences starting from the current position are the same (ignoring the current position). If they are the same, we move to the next position in both sentences. If at any point the words are not matching or the remaining words are not equal, we return false.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areSentencesSimilar(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        if (words1.length != words2.length) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int n = words1.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!words1[i].equals(words2[i])) {
                int j = n - 1;
                while (j > i && !words1[j].equals(words2[j])) {
                    j--;
                }
                if (i == j) {
                    return false;
                }
                i = j;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool areSentencesSimilar(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
        if (words1.size() != words2.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int n = words1.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (words1[i] != words2[i]) {
                int j = n - 1;
                while (j > i && words1[j] != words2[j]) {
                    j--;
                }
                if (i == j) {
                    return false;
                }
                i = j;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def areSentencesSimilar(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> bool:
        if len(words1) != len(words2):
            return False
        
        n = len(words1)
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if words1[i] != words2[i]:
                j = n - 1
                while j > i and words1[j] != words2[j]:
                    j -= 1
                if i == j:
                    return False
                i = j
            i += 1
        
        return True
