### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can perform a binary search on the given sorted array of characters. The key idea is to find the smallest character in the array that is greater than the target character. If such a character does not exist, we return the first character in the array.

1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `n-1`, where n is the size of the input array `letters`.
2. Perform binary search by updating `mid` as the middle index of the current range.
3. Check if `letters[mid]` is greater than the target character. If true, update `right` to `mid-1`.
4. If `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to the target character, update `left` to `mid+1`.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until `left > right`.
6. If `left` is still within the bounds of the array, return `letters[left]`. Otherwise, return `letters[0]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) where n is the size of the input array `letters`. The space complexity is O(1).

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = letters.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left < letters.length ? letters[left] : letters[0];
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = letters.size() - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left < letters.size() ? letters[left] : letters[0];
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        left = 0
        right = len(letters) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if letters[mid] <= target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return letters[left] if left < len(letters) else letters[0]
