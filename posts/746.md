### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array `dp` to store the minimum cost to reach each step. The base cases will be `dp[0] = cost[0]` and `dp[1] = cost[1]` as these are the costs to reach the first and second steps. For each subsequent step `i`, the minimum cost to reach that step will be `cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])`. Finally, we return the minimum of the costs to reach the last two steps, which represents reaching the top of the floor.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of steps.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) to store the array `dp`.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = cost[0];
        dp[1] = cost[1];
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = cost[i] + Math.min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]);
        }
        
        return Math.min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2]);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        vector<int> dp(n);
        dp[0] = cost[0];
        dp[1] = cost[1];
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]);
        }
        
        return min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2]);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(cost)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = cost[0]
        dp[1] = cost[1]
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
        
        return min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])
```
