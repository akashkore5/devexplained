### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to iteratively identify the regions of infected cells, quarantine the region that has the potential to infect the most uninfected cells, and install walls to prevent the spread of the virus.

1. Identify all infected regions using DFS and mark the perimeter cells.
2. Calculate the potential threat of each region by counting the number of uninfected cells adjacent to the perimeter.
3. Quarantine the region with the highest threat by installing walls and update the grid.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all regions are quarantined or the entire grid is infected.

Time Complexity: O(m * n * (m + n)) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.  
Space Complexity: O(m * n) for the visited array.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int containVirus(int[][] isInfected) {
        // Java solution here
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int containVirus(vector<vector<int>>& isInfected) {
        // C++ solution here
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def containVirus(self, isInfected: List[List[int]) -> int:
        # Python solution here
```
