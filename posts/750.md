### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each pair of rows in the given grid and count the number of pairs of columns that have 1s in the same positions in both rows. For each pair of rows, if we have `n` 1s in common between the columns of those two rows, we can form `n * (n-1) / 2` corner rectangles.

Here are the detailed steps:
1. Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the total number of corner rectangles.
2. Iterate through each pair of rows `i` and `j` in the grid.
3. For each pair of rows, iterate through each pair of columns `c1` and `c2`.
4. If both `grid[i][c1]` and `grid[j][c1]` are 1, and `grid[i][c2]` and `grid[j][c2]` are also 1, increment the `total` by 1.
5. Finally, return the total number of corner rectangles.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m^2 * n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. The space complexity is O(1).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countCornerRectangles(int[][] grid) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < grid.length; j++) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
                    if (grid[i][c] == 1 && grid[j][c] == 1) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                total += count * (count - 1) / 2;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countCornerRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size() - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < grid.size(); j++) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int c = 0; c < grid[0].size(); c++) {
                    if (grid[i][c] == 1 && grid[j][c] == 1) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                total += count * (count - 1) / 2;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countCornerRectangles(self, grid: List[List[int]) -> int:
        total = 0
        for i in range(len(grid) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(grid)):
                count = 0
                for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                    if grid[i][c] == 1 and grid[j][c] == 1:
                        count += 1
                total += count * (count - 1) // 2
        return total
```
