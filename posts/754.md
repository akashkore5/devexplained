## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of reaching the target by making moves left or right. The key insight is that the sum of the first `n` positive integers is `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. We can adjust the target to make use of this formula and then find the minimum number of moves required to reach that adjusted target.

1. Adjust the target:
   - Take the absolute value of the target to avoid confusion with direction.
   - Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of `1` to some `n`.
   - Increment `n` until `sum` is greater than or equal to the absolute target value.
   - Calculate the difference `diff = sum - target`.

2. Handle the parity of the difference:
   - If `diff` is even, we can reach the target by flipping the sign of some number. This is because moving back and forth the same distance cancels out the difference.
   - If `diff` is odd, we need to keep adding `n+1` to `sum` until the difference becomes even.

3. Calculate the minimum number of moves:
   - If the difference is even, the number of moves required is `n`.
   - If the difference is odd, we need to add `n+1` to make the difference even, which requires at least one more move.
```java
class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = Math.abs(target);
        int n = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        while (sum < target || (sum - target) % 2 != 0) {
            sum += n;
            n++;
        }
        return n - 1;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = abs(target);
        int n = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        while (sum < target || (sum - target) % 2 != 0) {
            sum += n;
            n++;
        }
        return n - 1;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def reachNumber(self, target: int) -> int:
        target = abs(target)
        n = 1
        sum_val = 0
        while sum_val < target or (sum_val - target) % 2 != 0:
            sum_val += n
            n += 1
        return n - 1
```
