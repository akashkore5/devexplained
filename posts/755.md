## Explanation:

The problem "Pour Water" can be solved by simulating the pouring process step by step. The idea is to pour water at a certain index and let it flow either left or right based on certain conditions. We repeat this process for each unit of water poured.

Algorithm:
1. Start pouring water at the given index.
2. Move the water to the left if possible until it reaches a lower level or the end of the array.
3. If no lower level is found towards the left, move the water to the right until a lower level is found or the end of the array.
4. If no lower level is found towards the right, pour the water at the original index.

Time Complexity: O(V * n) where V is the amount of water poured and n is the length of the heights array.
Space Complexity: O(1)

:
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] pourWater(int[] heights, int V, int K) {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            int cur = K;
            while (cur > 0 && heights[cur] >= heights[cur - 1]) {
                cur--;
            }
            while (cur < heights.length - 1 && heights[cur] >= heights[cur + 1]) {
                cur++;
            }
            while (cur > K && heights[cur] >= heights[cur - 1]) {
                cur--;
            }
            heights[cur]++;
        }
        return heights;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pourWater(vector<int>& heights, int V, int K) {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            int cur = K;
            while (cur > 0 && heights[cur] >= heights[cur - 1]) {
                cur--;
            }
            while (cur < heights.size() - 1 && heights[cur] >= heights[cur + 1]) {
                cur++;
            }
            while (cur > K && heights[cur] >= heights[cur - 1]) {
                cur--;
            }
            heights[cur]++;
        }
        return heights;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def pourWater(self, heights: List[int], V: int, K: int) -> List[int]:
        for _ in range(V):
            cur = K
            while cur > 0 and heights[cur] >= heights[cur - 1]:
                cur -= 1
            while cur < len(heights) - 1 and heights[cur] >= heights[cur + 1]:
                cur += 1
            while cur > K and heights[cur] >= heights[cur - 1]:
                cur -= 1
            heights[cur] += 1
        return heights
```
