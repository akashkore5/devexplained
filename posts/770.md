### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of parsing, evaluating expressions, and manipulating polynomials. We will first parse the input expression and evaluate it using the given evaluation map. Then, we will manipulate the resulting polynomial to format the output as required.

1. **Parsing Input**: We will parse the input expression and create a list of tokens where each token is a variable, constant, operator, or parentheses.
2. **Evaluating Expression**: We will evaluate the expression using the evaluation map provided. This involves evaluating expressions within parentheses, performing arithmetic operations, and substituting variables with their corresponding values.
3. **Manipulating Polynomials**: After evaluating the expression, we will represent it as a polynomial. We will then format the polynomial terms according to the specified rules and output the simplified expression.

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is O(N * M), where N is the length of the expression and M is the number of unique terms in the resulting polynomial.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(N * M) due to the storage needed for the intermediate tokens and polynomial terms.
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> basicCalculatorIV(String expression, String[] evalvars, int[] evalints) {
        // Implement the solution in Java
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> basicCalculatorIV(string expression, vector<string>& evalvars, vector<int>& evalints) {
        // Implement the solution in C++
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def basicCalculatorIV(self, expression: str, evalvars: List[str], evalints: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        # Implement the solution in Python
```
