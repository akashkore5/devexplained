## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each stone in the `stones` string and check if it is present in the `jewels` string. If it is present, we increment a counter to keep track of the number of stones that are jewels. We can use a `Set` in Java or a `unordered_set` in C++ to store the types of jewels for efficient lookup. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the `stones` string, and the space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique jewels.
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        Set<Character> jewelSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (char jewel : jewels.toCharArray()) {
            jewelSet.add(jewel);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (char stone : stones.toCharArray()) {
            if (jewelSet.contains(stone)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(std::string jewels, std::string stones) {
        std::unordered_set<char> jewelSet(jewels.begin(), jewels.end());
        
        int count = 0;
        for (char stone : stones) {
            if (jewelSet.find(stone) != jewelSet.end()) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        jewel_set = set(jewels)
        
        count = 0
        for stone in stones:
            if stone in jewel_set:
                count += 1
        
        return count
```
