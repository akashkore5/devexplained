### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can observe that for each row, the first half of the row is the same as the previous row, and the second half is the complement of the previous row. This allows us to recursively determine the value of the k-th symbol by looking at the parent row and adjusting the index based on whether k is in the first half or the second half of the row.

### Algorithm
1. If n = 1, return 0 since the first row is always 0.
2. Recursively find the value of the parent row at position (k+1)/2.
3. If k is in the first half of the row, return the value from the parent row.
4. If k is in the second half of the row, return the complement of the value from the parent row.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) as we are recursively reducing the problem size by half.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(log n) due to the recursion stack space.

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int parent = kthGrammar(n-1, (k+1)/2);
        
        if (k % 2 == 0) {
            return 1 - parent;
        } else {
            return parent;
        }
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int parent = kthGrammar(n-1, (k+1)/2);
        
        if (k % 2 == 0) {
            return 1 - parent;
        } else {
            return parent;
        }
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def kthGrammar(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        
        parent = self.kthGrammar(n-1, (k+1)//2)
        
        if k % 2 == 0:
            return 1 - parent
        else:
            return parent
```
