### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest given the answers provided by the rabbits. The key observation is that for a rabbit that answers "x", there can be at most x+1 rabbits with the same color. If there are more than x+1 rabbits with the same color, they would have different answers which contradict the information given.

Therefore, we can keep track of the count of rabbits of each color using a hashmap. For each rabbit's answer, we update the count of rabbits with that color. If the count exceeds the answer, we add (answer + 1) to the result which represents the current rabbit and additional rabbits of the same color.
:
```java
class Solution {
    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int answer : answers) {
            int count = map.getOrDefault(answer, 0);
            if (count % (answer + 1) == 0) {
                result += answer + 1;
            }
            map.put(answer, count + 1);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int answer : answers) {
            int count = map[answer];
            if (count % (answer + 1) == 0) {
                result += answer + 1;
            }
            map[answer] = count + 1;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        map = {}
        result = 0
        
        for answer in answers:
            count = map.get(answer, 0)
            if count % (answer + 1) == 0:
                result += answer + 1
            map[answer] = count + 1
        
        return result
```
