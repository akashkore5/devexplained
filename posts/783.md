### Explanation
To find the minimum difference between values of any two different nodes in a BST, we can perform an in-order traversal of the tree and keep track of the previous node's value. As we traverse the tree in-order, we compare the current node's value with the previous node's value and calculate the minimum difference. We update the minimum difference whenever we find a smaller one.

#### Algorithm:
1. Perform an in-order traversal of the BST.
2. Keep track of the previous node's value.
3. Calculate the difference between the current node's value and the previous node's value.
4. Update the minimum difference if a smaller difference is found.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the BST.  
Space complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the BST.

```java
class Solution {
    Integer prev;
    int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    
    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        inorder(root);
        return minDiff;
    }
    
    private void inorder(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        
        inorder(node.left);
        
        if (prev != null) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, node.val - prev);
        }
        prev = node.val;
        
        inorder(node.right);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDiffInBST(TreeNode* root) {
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        int prev = -1;
        inOrder(root, prev, minDiff);
        return minDiff;
    }
    
    void inOrder(TreeNode* node, int& prev, int& minDiff) {
        if (node == nullptr) return;
        
        inOrder(node->left, prev, minDiff);
        
        if (prev != -1) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, node->val - prev);
        }
        prev = node->val;
        
        inOrder(node->right, prev, minDiff);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minDiffInBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.prev = None
        self.minDiff = float('inf')
        self.inorder(root)
        return self.minDiff
    
    def inorder(self, node):
        if not node:
            return
        
        self.inorder(node.left)
        
        if self.prev is not None:
            self.minDiff = min(self.minDiff, node.val - self.prev)
        self.prev = node.val
        
        self.inorder(node.right)
```
