## Explanation:
To determine if a graph is bipartite, we can use graph coloring. The idea is to assign colors (let's say 0 and 1) to the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. If we can color all nodes in this way, the graph is bipartite.

We can start by iterating through each node in the graph. For each uncolored node, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) to color the node and its neighbors with the opposite color. If at any point we encounter a conflict (i.e., a neighbor with the same color as the current node), the graph is not bipartite.

After coloring all nodes, if we are able to color all nodes without any conflicts, then the graph is bipartite.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array to store the color of each node. Use 0 and 1 for coloring.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. For each uncolored node, perform a DFS to assign colors to the node and its neighbors.
4. During the DFS, if we encounter a conflict (neighbor with the same color as the current node), return false.
5. If we are able to color all nodes without conflicts, return true.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V) for storing the colors of the nodes.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] colors = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == 0 && !dfs(i, 1, colors, graph)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(int node, int color, int[] colors, int[][] graph) {
        colors[node] = color;
        
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (colors[neighbor] == color) {
                return false;
            }
            if (colors[neighbor] == 0 && !dfs(neighbor, -color, colors, graph)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int> colors(n, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == 0 && !dfs(i, 1, colors, graph)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    bool dfs(int node, int color, vector<int>& colors, vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        colors[node] = color;
        
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (colors[neighbor] == color) {
                return false;
            }
            if (colors[neighbor] == 0 && !dfs(neighbor, -color, colors, graph)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(graph)
        colors = [0] * n
        
        def dfs(node, color):
            colors[node] = color
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if colors[neighbor] == color:
                    return False
                if colors[neighbor] == 0 and not dfs(neighbor, -color):
                    return False
            return True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if colors[i] == 0 and not dfs(i, 1):
                return False
        
        return True
