### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm with a slight modification to keep track of the number of stops. We will create a priority queue to store the cities along with the total cost and stops taken to reach that city. We will continuously explore the cities with the minimum cost until we reach the destination or exhaust the allowed number of stops.

1. Initialize a priority queue and add the source city with cost 0 and stops 0.
2. While the priority queue is not empty, pop the city with the minimum cost.
3. If the popped city is the destination, return the cost.
4. If the number of stops taken is more than k, continue to the next iteration.
5. Explore all the flights from the current city and add them to the priority queue with the updated cost and stops.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the priority queue is empty.
7. If no valid path is found, return -1.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is O(E log E), where E represents the number of edges in the graph.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(E) for the priority queue to store the cities.
