### Explanation
To determine if it is possible to escape the ghosts and reach the target before any ghost catches up, we need to calculate the Manhattan distance between the player's current position and the target, as well as the Manhattan distance between each ghost's position and the target. If the player's distance to the target is less than the distance of any ghost to the target, then the player can escape.

### Algorithm
1. Calculate the player's Manhattan distance to the target.
2. For each ghost, calculate the Manhattan distance to the target.
3. If the player's distance is less than or equal to any ghost's distance, return false.
4. If the player's distance is greater than all ghosts' distances, return true.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of ghosts.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean escapeGhosts(int[][] ghosts, int[] target) {
        int playerDist = Math.abs(target[0]) + Math.abs(target[1]);
        
        for (int[] ghost : ghosts) {
            int ghostDist = Math.abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + Math.abs(ghost[1] - target[1]);
            if (ghostDist <= playerDist) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool escapeGhosts(vector<vector<int>>& ghosts, vector<int>& target) {
        int playerDist = abs(target[0]) + abs(target[1]);
        
        for (auto& ghost : ghosts) {
            int ghostDist = abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + abs(ghost[1] - target[1]);
            if (ghostDist <= playerDist) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def escapeGhosts(self, ghosts: List[List[int]], target: List[int]) -> bool:
        playerDist = abs(target[0]) + abs(target[1])
        
        for ghost in ghosts:
            ghostDist = abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + abs(ghost[1] - target[1])
            if ghostDist <= playerDist:
                return False
        
        return True
```
