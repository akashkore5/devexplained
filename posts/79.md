## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each cell in the grid. At each step, we check if the current cell matches the next character in the word. If it does, we mark the cell as visited and recursively explore its neighboring cells. We continue this process until we either find the entire word or reach a dead end.

### Algorithm:
1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, perform a DFS starting from that cell to check if the word can be formed.
3. In the DFS function:
   - Check if the current cell is out of bounds or has already been visited.
   - Check if the current cell matches the next character in the word.
   - Mark the cell as visited, and recursively explore its neighboring cells.
4. If the word is found during the DFS, return true. Otherwise, return false.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(m * n * 4^l), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, and l is the length of the word. The factor of 4^l comes from the branching factor of the DFS.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(l), where l is the length of the word, due to the recursive calls in the DFS.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (dfs(board, i, j, word, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j, String word, int index) {
        if (index == word.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[0].length || board[i][j] != word.charAt(index)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = ' ';
        boolean found = dfs(board, i + 1, j, word, index + 1)
                    || dfs(board, i - 1, j, word, index + 1)
                    || dfs(board, i, j + 1, word, index + 1)
                    || dfs(board, i, j - 1, word, index + 1);
        board[i][j] = temp;
        
        return found;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); j++) {
                if (dfs(board, i, j, word, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    bool dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, string& word, int index) {
        if (index == word.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || board[i][j] != word[index]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = ' ';
        bool found = dfs(board, i + 1, j, word, index + 1)
                    || dfs(board, i - 1, j, word, index + 1)
                    || dfs(board, i, j + 1, word, index + 1)
                    || dfs(board, i, j - 1, word, index + 1);
        board[i][j] = temp;
        
        return found;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if self.dfs(board, i, j, word, 0):
                    return True
        return False
    
    def dfs(self, board, i, j, word, index):
        if index == len(word):
            return True
        
        if i < 0 or i >= len(board) or j < 0 or j >= len(board[0]) or board[i][j] != word[index]:
            return False
        
        temp = board[i][j]
        board[i][j] = ' '
        found = self.dfs(board, i + 1, j, word, index + 1) \
              or self.dfs(board, i - 1, j, word, index + 1) \
              or self.dfs(board, i, j + 1, word, index + 1) \
              or self.dfs(board, i, j - 1, word, index + 1)
        board[i][j] = temp
        
        return found
