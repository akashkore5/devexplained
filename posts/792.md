### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate over each word in the array and check if it is a subsequence of the given string `s`. We can do this by maintaining pointers for each word and the string `s`. We iterate over each character in the string and for each character in the word, we move the pointer in the word only if we find a match in the string.

- Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of words that are subsequences of `s`.
- For each word in the array:
  - Initialize pointers `wordPtr` and `sPtr` to 0.
  - Iterate over each character in the string `s`:
    - If the current character in `s` matches the character at `wordPtr` in the current word:
      - Increment `wordPtr`.
    - If `wordPtr` reaches the end of the word, increment the counter and break out of the loop.

At the end, return the counter which represents the number of words that are subsequences of `s`.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * m) where n is the length of the given string `s` and m is the average length of words in the array.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numMatchingSubseq(String s, String[] words) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            int wordPtr = 0, sPtr = 0;
            while (sPtr < s.length() && wordPtr < word.length()) {
                if (s.charAt(sPtr) == word.charAt(wordPtr)) {
                    wordPtr++;
                }
                sPtr++;
            }
            if (wordPtr == word.length()) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numMatchingSubseq(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            int wordPtr = 0, sPtr = 0;
            while (sPtr < s.size() && wordPtr < word.size()) {
                if (s[sPtr] == word[wordPtr]) {
                    wordPtr++;
                }
                sPtr++;
            }
            if (wordPtr == word.size()) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for word in words:
            wordPtr = 0
            sPtr = 0
            while sPtr < len(s) and wordPtr < len(word):
                if s[sPtr] == word[wordPtr]:
                    wordPtr += 1
                sPtr += 1
            if wordPtr == len(word):
                count += 1
        return count
```
