### Explanation
To find all possible paths from node 0 to node n-1 in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from node 0. We will keep track of the current path being explored and when reaching node n-1, we will add the current path to the result.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty list to store all paths.
2. Perform a DFS starting from node 0.
3. During DFS, keep track of the current path being explored.
4. When reaching node n-1, add the current path to the result.
5. Recursively explore all neighbors of the current node.
6. Backtrack by removing the last node from the current path.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes in the graph.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(N) for the recursion stack and the paths stored.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        List<List<Integer>> paths = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> currentPath = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(0, graph, currentPath, paths);
        return paths;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int node, int[][] graph, List<Integer> currentPath, List<List<Integer>> paths) {
        currentPath.add(node);
        if (node == graph.length - 1) {
            paths.add(new ArrayList<>(currentPath));
        } else {
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                dfs(neighbor, graph, currentPath, paths);
            }
        }
        currentPath.remove(currentPath.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& currentPath, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
        currentPath.push_back(node);
        if (node == graph.size() - 1) {
            paths.push_back(currentPath);
        } else {
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                dfs(neighbor, graph, currentPath, paths);
            }
        }
        currentPath.pop_back();
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>> paths;
        vector<int> currentPath;
        dfs(0, graph, currentPath, paths);
        return paths;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        paths = []
        current_path = []
        
        def dfs(node, current_path):
            current_path.append(node)
            if node == len(graph) - 1:
                paths.append(current_path.copy())
            else:
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    dfs(neighbor, current_path)
            current_path.pop()
        
        dfs(0, current_path)
        return paths
```
