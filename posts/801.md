## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We define two arrays `dpKeep` and `dpSwap` to keep track of the minimum number of swaps needed to make `nums1` and `nums2` strictly increasing up to index `i` while keeping `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]` unchanged or swapping them respectively. We update these arrays based on the previous indices.

At each index `i`, we have two options:
1. If `nums1[i] > nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[i] > nums2[i-1]`, we can keep the current elements as they are. In this case, the number of swaps needed is the same as the previous index for keeping both arrays.
2. If `nums1[i] > nums2[i-1]` and `nums2[i] > nums1[i-1]`, we can swap the current elements. In this case, the number of swaps needed is the minimum of swapping both arrays or keeping one array and swapping the other.

The final answer will be the minimum of the number of swaps needed at the last index for keeping both arrays and swapping them.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input arrays
Space complexity: O(1) as we only use constant extra space for the two arrays
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwap(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int[] dpKeep = new int[n];
        int[] dpSwap = new int[n];
        
        // Base case
        dpSwap[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dpKeep[i] = dpSwap[i] = n;
            if (nums1[i] > nums1[i-1] && nums2[i] > nums2[i-1]) {
                dpKeep[i] = dpKeep[i-1];
                dpSwap[i] = dpSwap[i-1] + 1;
            }
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[i-1] && nums2[i] > nums1[i-1]) {
                dpKeep[i] = Math.min(dpKeep[i], dpSwap[i-1]);
                dpSwap[i] = Math.min(dpSwap[i], dpKeep[i-1] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return Math.min(dpKeep[n-1], dpSwap[n-1]);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwap(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        vector<int> dpKeep(n, 0);
        vector<int> dpSwap(n, 1);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dpKeep[i] = dpSwap[i] = n;
            if (nums1[i] > nums1[i-1] && nums2[i] > nums2[i-1]) {
                dpKeep[i] = dpKeep[i-1];
                dpSwap[i] = dpSwap[i-1] + 1;
            }
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[i-1] && nums2[i] > nums1[i-1]) {
                dpKeep[i] = min(dpKeep[i], dpSwap[i-1]);
                dpSwap[i] = min(dpSwap[i], dpKeep[i-1] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return min(dpKeep[n-1], dpSwap[n-1]);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minSwap(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums1)
        dpKeep = [0] * n
        dpSwap = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dpKeep[i] = dpSwap[i] = n
            if nums1[i] > nums1[i-1] and nums2[i] > nums2[i-1]:
                dpKeep[i] = dpKeep[i-1]
                dpSwap[i] = dpSwap[i-1] + 1
            if nums1[i] > nums2[i-1] and nums2[i] > nums1[i-1]:
                dpKeep[i] = min(dpKeep[i], dpSwap[i-1])
                dpSwap[i] = min(dpSwap[i], dpKeep[i-1] + 1)
        
        return min(dpKeep[n-1], dpSwap[n-1])
