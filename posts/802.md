## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of detecting cycles in a directed graph. We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the graph starting from each node. If we encounter a cycle during the traversal, then the current node and all its descendants are not safe. Otherwise, if we reach a terminal node or a node that has already been marked safe during the traversal, then the current node is safe.

We will mark nodes as one of the following:
1. `0` - unvisited
2. `1` - currently visiting (part of the current DFS traversal)
3. `2` - safe

At the end of the algorithm, the nodes marked as safe will be added to the result array.

Time Complexity: O(N + E) where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph.
Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eventualSafeNodes(int[][] graph) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] state = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (isSafeNode(i, graph, state)) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean isSafeNode(int node, int[][] graph, int[] state) {
        if (state[node] != 0) {
            return state[node] == 2;
        }
        
        state[node] = 1;
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (!isSafeNode(neighbor, graph, state)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        state[node] = 2;
        return true;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<int> result;
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int> state(n, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (isSafeNode(i, graph, state)) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    bool isSafeNode(int node, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& state) {
        if (state[node] != 0) {
            return state[node] == 2;
        }
        
        state[node] = 1;
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (!isSafeNode(neighbor, graph, state)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        state[node] = 2;
        return true;
    }

```

    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        n = len(graph)
        state = [0] * n
        
        def isSafeNode(node, graph, state):
            if state[node] != 0:
                return state[node] == 2
            
            state[node] = 1
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not isSafeNode(neighbor, graph, state):
                    return False
            
            state[node] = 2
            return True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if isSafeNode(i, graph, state):
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
