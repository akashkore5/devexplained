### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the brick erasures and track the stable bricks after each erasure. We can do this by first marking all the bricks that are initially stable by connecting them to the top row using a virtual node. Then, we can iterate over the hit locations in reverse order, erasing the bricks one by one, updating the stability of the remaining bricks, and counting the number of bricks that fall.

Algorithm:
1. Connect all the top row bricks to a virtual node.
2. Mark all the initially stable bricks.
3. For each hit location in reverse order:
   - Erase the brick at the hit location.
   - Update the stability of remaining bricks using a union-find data structure.
   - Count the number of falling bricks.
4. Return the falling brick count after each erasure.

Time Complexity: O(m * n + hits) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
Space Complexity: O(m * n)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] hitBricks(int[][] grid, int[][] hits) {
        // Java solution
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> hitBricks(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& hits) {
        // C++ solution
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def hitBricks(self, grid: List[List[int]], hits: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Python solution
```
