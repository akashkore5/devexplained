### Explanation

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased by without changing the city's skyline from any cardinal direction. We can achieve this by iterating over the grid and calculating the maximum allowable height for each building based on the skylines viewed from the north and east directions. We then find the minimum value between these two constraints to ensure that the skyline is not affected in any direction.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize two arrays `maxRows` and `maxCols` to store the maximum building height seen from the north and east directions respectively.
2. Iterate over the grid to fill the `maxRows` array with the maximum height seen from each row.
3. Iterate over the grid again to fill the `maxCols` array with the maximum height seen from each column.
4. Iterate over the grid once more to calculate the maximum allowable height increase for each building based on the skyline constraints.
5. Sum up all the allowable height increases to get the maximum total sum.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the size of the grid.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) to store the `maxRows` and `maxCols` arrays.
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int[] maxRows = new int[n];
        int[] maxCols = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                maxRows[i] = Math.max(maxRows[i], grid[i][j]);
                maxCols[j] = Math.max(maxCols[j], grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
        
        int maxIncrease = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                maxIncrease += Math.min(maxRows[i], maxCols[j]) - grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return maxIncrease;
    }
}
```
