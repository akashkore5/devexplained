### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string `s` twice. In the first iteration, we find the distance to the closest occurrence of character `c` by going from left to right. In the second iteration, we find the distance from the closest occurrence of character `c` by going from right to left. We then take the minimum of these two distances at each index to get the final answer array.

- **Algorithm:**
  1. Initialize two arrays `left` and `right` of size `s.length()` to store the distances from left and right respectively.
  2. Initialize variables `prev` and `result` to store the previous occurrence index of character `c` and the final answer array.
  3. Iterate through the string `s` from left to right, updating `left` and `prev`.
  4. Iterate through the string `s` from right to left, updating `right` and calculating the minimum distance.
  
- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the length of the input string `s`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the two arrays `left` and `right`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] shortestToChar(String s, char c) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        int prev = Integer.MIN_VALUE / 2;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == c) {
                prev = i;
            }
            ans[i] = i - prev;
        }

        prev = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == c) {
                prev = i;
            }
            ans[i] = Math.min(ans[i], prev - i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestToChar(string s, char c) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);
        int prev = INT_MIN / 2;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s[i] == c) {
                prev = i;
            }
            ans[i] = i - prev;
        }

        prev = INT_MAX / 2;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == c) {
                prev = i;
            }
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], prev - i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestToChar(self, s: str, c: str) -> List[int]:
        n = len(s)
        ans = [0] * n
        prev = float('-inf') // 2

        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == c:
                prev = i
            ans[i] = i - prev

        prev = float('inf') // 2
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == c:
                prev = i
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], prev - i)

        return ans
