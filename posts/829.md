### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible lengths of consecutive numbers starting from 1. For each length, we calculate the sum of the sequence using the formula (length * (length + 1)) / 2. If this sum is divisible by n, then it means there is a valid solution. We can calculate the starting number of the sequence using the formula (n - sum) / length + 1.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to store the number of ways.
2. Iterate `length` from 1 to n and for each length:
   - Calculate the sum of the sequence using the formula (length * (length + 1)) / 2.
   - Calculate the starting number of the sequence using the formula (n - sum) / length + 1.
   - If the starting number is a positive integer, increment `count`.
3. Return `count`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
            double sum = (length * (length + 1)) / 2.0;
            int start = (int)((n - sum) / length) + 1;
            
            if (start > 0 && sum == n) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
            double sum = (length * (length + 1)) / 2.0;
            int start = (int)((n - sum) / length) + 1;
            
            if (start > 0 && sum == n) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        for length in range(1, n+1):
            sum_val = (length * (length + 1)) / 2
            start = int((n - sum_val) / length) + 1
            
            if start > 0 and sum_val == n:
                count += 1
        
        return count
