### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the linked list and remove any duplicates we encounter. Since the list is sorted, duplicates will be adjacent to each other. We can traverse the list and compare each node with its next node. If they have the same value, we can skip the next node. If they have different values, we move to the next node.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a pointer `current` to the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list while `current` and `current.next` are not null.
3. Compare the values of `current` and `current.next`.
4. If the values are the same, set `current.next` to `current.next.next` to remove the duplicate.
5. If the values are different, move `current` to `current.next`.
6. Return the modified linked list.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            if (current.val == current.next.val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* current = head;
        while (current != nullptr && current->next != nullptr) {
            if (current->val == current->next->val) {
                current->next = current->next->next;
            } else {
                current = current->next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        current = head
        while current and current.next:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next
        return head
```
