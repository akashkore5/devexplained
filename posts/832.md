### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to first reverse each row of the input image matrix. Then, we invert the values in the matrix by flipping 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s. This process can be achieved by iterating through each row, reversing it, and then flipping the values.

#### Algorithm:
1. Iterate through each row of the image matrix.
2. Reverse each row.
3. Invert the values in each row.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the size of the input image matrix.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are modifying the input matrix in place.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] flipAndInvertImage(int[][] image) {
        int n = image.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int left = 0;
            int right = n - 1;
            while (left <= right) {
                int temp = image[i][left] ^ 1;
                image[i][left] = image[i][right] ^ 1;
                image[i][right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return image;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> flipAndInvertImage(vector<vector<int>>& image) {
        int n = image.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int left = 0;
            int right = n - 1;
            while (left <= right) {
                int temp = image[i][left] ^ 1;
                image[i][left] = image[i][right] ^ 1;
                image[i][right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return image;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def flipAndInvertImage(self, image: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(image)
        
        for i in range(n):
            left = 0
            right = n - 1
            while left <= right:
                image[i][left], image[i][right] = image[i][right] ^ 1, image[i][left] ^ 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        
        return image
```
