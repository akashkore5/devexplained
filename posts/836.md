### Explanation:
To determine if two rectangles overlap, we need to check if there exists an intersection area between the two rectangles. The rectangles are represented by their bottom-left and top-right coordinates. If the intersection area is positive, then the rectangles overlap.

The idea is to check for overlap by comparing the x and y coordinates of the rectangles. If there is an overlap along both x and y axes, then the rectangles overlap.

**Algorithm:**
1. Check if the rectangles overlap along the x-axis by comparing the x-coordinates of the rectangles.
2. Check if the rectangles overlap along the y-axis by comparing the y-coordinates of the rectangles.
3. If there is overlap along both axes, return true; otherwise, return false.

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm has a constant time complexity as it performs a fixed number of comparisons.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isRectangleOverlap(int[] rec1, int[] rec2) {
        return (rec1[0] < rec2[2] && rec1[1] < rec2[3] && rec1[2] > rec2[0] && rec1[3] > rec2[1]);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRectangleOverlap(vector<int>& rec1, vector<int>& rec2) {
        return (rec1[0] < rec2[2] && rec1[1] < rec2[3] && rec1[2] > rec2[0] && rec1[3] > rec2[1]);
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        return (rec1[0] < rec2[2] and rec1[1] < rec2[3] and rec1[2] > rec2[0] and rec1[3] > rec2[1])
```
