### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will iterate backwards starting from point k, calculating the probability of having n or fewer points at each step. At each point, the probability of having n or fewer points is the sum of the probabilities of reaching n or fewer points in the next maxPts draws, divided by maxPts. We will store these probabilities in an array and return the probability at the starting point 0.

- Time complexity: O(n * maxPts)
- Space complexity: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        double[] dp = new double[n + maxPts + 1];
        double sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = k; i <= n && i < k + maxPts; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1.0;
            sum += dp[i];
        }
        
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i] = sum / maxPts;
            sum += dp[i] - dp[i + maxPts];
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        vector<double> dp(n + maxPts + 1);
        double sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = k; i <= n && i < k + maxPts; i++) {
            dp[i] = 1.0;
            sum += dp[i];
        }
        
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i] = sum / maxPts;
            sum += dp[i] - dp[i + maxPts];
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, n: int, k: int, maxPts: int) -> float:
        dp = [0.0] * (n + maxPts + 1)
        sum_val = 0
        
        for i in range(k, min(n, k + maxPts)):
            dp[i] = 1.0
            sum_val += dp[i]
        
        for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = sum_val / maxPts
            sum_val += dp[i] - dp[i + maxPts]
        
        return dp[0]
```
