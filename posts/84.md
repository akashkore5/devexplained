### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars in the histogram. We iterate through the histogram and for each bar, we check if its height is greater than the height of the bar at the index on top of the stack. If it is, we push the current index onto the stack. If not, we keep popping indices from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the popped bar as the smallest bar and the current bar. We keep track of the maximum area found so far.

At the end of the iteration, we may still have some bars left in the stack. We continue popping bars from the stack and calculate the area until the stack is empty.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
```java
class Solution {
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int maxArea = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= heights.length; i++) {
            int currHeight = (i == heights.length) ? 0 : heights[i];
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && currHeight < heights[stack.peek()]) {
                int height = heights[stack.pop()];
                int width = stack.isEmpty() ? i : i - stack.peek() - 1;
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        stack<int> s;
        int maxArea = 0;
        heights.push_back(0); // Adding a sentinel value at the end
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
            while (!s.empty() && heights[i] < heights[s.top()]) {
                int height = heights[s.top()];
                s.pop();
                int width = s.empty() ? i : i - s.top() - 1;
                maxArea = max(maxArea, height * width);
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        max_area = 0
        heights.append(0)  # Adding a sentinel value at the end
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
            stack.append(i)
        return max_area
