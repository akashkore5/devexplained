## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We start by visiting room 0 and add its keys to a set of visited rooms. Then, we recursively visit all the rooms that can be unlocked with the keys obtained from the current room. We continue this process until we either visit all rooms or cannot unlock any more rooms. If we have visited all rooms by the end, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

**Time Complexity:** O(n + e), where n is the number of rooms and e is the total number of keys.

**Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of rooms.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canVisitAllRooms(List<List<Integer>> rooms) {
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        dfs(rooms, 0, visited);
        return visited.size() == rooms.size();
    }
    
    private void dfs(List<List<Integer>> rooms, int room, Set<Integer> visited) {
        visited.add(room);
        for (int key : rooms.get(room)) {
            if (!visited.contains(key)) {
                dfs(rooms, key, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        dfs(rooms, 0, visited);
        return visited.size() == rooms.size();
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& rooms, int room, unordered_set<int>& visited) {
        visited.insert(room);
        for (int key : rooms[room]) {
            if (visited.find(key) == visited.end()) {
                dfs(rooms, key, visited);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
    
        def dfs(room):
            visited.add(room)
            for key in rooms[room]:
                if key not in visited:
                    dfs(key)
        
        dfs(0)
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)
