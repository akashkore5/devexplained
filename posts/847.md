### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm along with bit manipulation to keep track of visited nodes. We will maintain a state for each visited node and use a bitmask to represent the visited nodes. We will start the BFS from all possible starting nodes and track the shortest path that visits every node.

1. Initialize a queue for BFS, a set to store visited states, and a distance counter.
2. For each node as a starting point, add the initial state (node, bitmask of visited nodes) to the queue.
3. Perform BFS by exploring neighbors of the current state. Update the visited set and enqueue the new state if not visited.
4. Keep track of the minimum distance that visits all nodes.
5. Repeat the process for all possible starting nodes.
6. Return the minimum distance found.

Time Complexity: O(2^n * n^2), where n is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity: O(2^n * n).

    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            queue.offer(new int[] {i, 1 << i, 0});
            visited.add(i + " " + (1 << i));
        }
        
        int target = (1 << n) - 1;

            int[] curr = queue.poll();
            int node = curr[0];
