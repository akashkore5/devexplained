### Explanation:
- We can solve this problem by iterating through the array and finding the maximum distance between consecutive occupied seats or the start/end of the array and an occupied seat.
- We calculate the distance by keeping track of the last index of an occupied seat and updating the maximum distance whenever we find a new occupied seat.
- We handle the edge cases of the first and last seat separately to calculate the distance to the closest person from the start and end respectively.
- Finally, we return the maximum distance calculated.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of seats\
Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int maxDistance = 0;
        int lastOccupied = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                if (lastOccupied == -1) {
                    maxDistance = i;
                } else {
                    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, (i - lastOccupied) / 2);
                }
                lastOccupied = i;
            }
        }
        
        return Math.max(maxDistance, seats.length - 1 - lastOccupied);
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistToClosest(vector<int>& seats) {
        int maxDistance = 0;
        int lastOccupied = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                if (lastOccupied == -1) {
                    maxDistance = i;
                } else {
                    maxDistance = max(maxDistance, (i - lastOccupied) / 2);
                }
                lastOccupied = i;
            }
        }
        
        return max(maxDistance, (int)seats.size() - 1 - lastOccupied);
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistToClosest(self, seats: List[int]) -> int:
        maxDistance = 0
        lastOccupied = -1
        
        for i in range(len(seats)):
            if seats[i] == 1:
                if lastOccupied == -1:
                    maxDistance = i
                else:
                    maxDistance = max(maxDistance, (i - lastOccupied) // 2)
                lastOccupied = i
        
        return max(maxDistance, len(seats) - 1 - lastOccupied)
