### Explanation

To solve this problem, we can simulate the car fleets moving towards the target mile. We can sort the cars based on their starting positions. Then, starting from the last car, we calculate the time taken by each car to reach the target mile. If a car reaches the target before the car in front of it, they form a fleet. Otherwise, they are separate fleets. We keep track of the fleet count.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting  
Space Complexity: O(n)  
```java
class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        int n = position.length;
        int[][] cars = new int[n][2];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cars[i][0] = position[i];
            cars[i][1] = speed[i];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(cars, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]));
        
        int fleets = 0;
        double time = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            double arrivalTime = (double) (target - cars[i][0]) / cars[i][1];
            
            if (arrivalTime > time) {
                time = arrivalTime;
                fleets++;
            }
        }
        
        return fleets;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int carFleet(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        int n = position.size();
        vector<pair<int, double>> cars(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cars[i] = {position[i], (double)(target - position[i]) / speed[i]};
        }
        
        sort(cars.rbegin(), cars.rend());
        
        int fleets = 0;
        double time = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (cars[i].second > time) {
                time = cars[i].second;
                fleets++;
            }
        }
        
        return fleets;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(position)
        cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), reverse=True)
        
        fleets = 0
        time = -1
        
        for p, s in cars:
            arrival_time = (target - p) / s
            if arrival_time > time:
                time = arrival_time
                fleets += 1
        
        return fleets
```
