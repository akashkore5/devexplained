### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the scores as we iterate through the input string. We will maintain a variable `cur` to store the score of the current frame. When we encounter a `(`, we push the current score `cur` onto the stack and reset `cur` to 0. When we encounter a `)`, we calculate the score for the current frame. If the previous character was a `(`, then the score for the current frame is `1`. Otherwise, the score is `2 * cur`. We add this score to the top of the stack (if it exists) and update `cur` to be the sum of the current score and the score from the stack.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n) as we are using a stack to store intermediate scores.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int scoreOfParentheses(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int cur = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                stack.push(cur);
                cur = 0;
            } else {
                cur = stack.pop() + Math.max(1, 2 * cur);
            }
        }
        
        return cur;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfParentheses(string s) {
        stack<int> st;
        int cur = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                st.push(cur);
                cur = 0;
            } else {
                cur = st.top() + max(1, 2 * cur);
                st.pop();
            }
        }
        
        return cur;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        cur = 0
        
        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                stack.append(cur)
                cur = 0
            else:
                cur = stack.pop() + max(1, 2 * cur)
        
        return cur
```
