### Explanation
To transpose a matrix, we need to flip the matrix over its main diagonal, which means swapping the rows and columns. We can achieve this by iterating through the original matrix and constructing a new transposed matrix. The transposed matrix will have the number of rows equal to the number of columns of the original matrix and vice versa.

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Initialize a new 2D array to store the transposed matrix with dimensions `n x m`.
  2. Iterate through each element of the original matrix.
  3. Place the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix to position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix.
  4. Return the transposed matrix.

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the original matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the transposed matrix.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        
        int[][] transposed = new int[n][m];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return transposed;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transpose(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> transposed(n, vector<int>(m));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return transposed;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def transpose(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        transposed = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
        
        return transposed
```
