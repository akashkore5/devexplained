### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Sort the array of people in non-decreasing order.
2. Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other starting from the end of the array.
3. While the two pointers don't overlap, check if the sum of weights of the two persons pointed by the pointers is less than or equal to the limit. If yes, increment both pointers. If not, increment only the end pointer.
4. Increment the boat count each time we pair up people or when we have a single person in the boat.
5. Continue this process until both pointers overlap.

The time complexity of this solution is O(nlogn) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of people. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using constant extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int boats = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = people.length - 1;
        
        while (i <= j) {
            if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                i++;
            }
            j--;
            boats++;
        }
        
        return boats;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int boats = 0;
        int i = 0, j = people.size() - 1;
        
        while (i <= j) {
            if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                i++;
            }
            j--;
            boats++;
        }
        
        return boats;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        boats = 0
        i, j = 0, len(people) - 1
        
        while i <= j:
            if people[i] + people[j] <= limit:
                i += 1
            j -= 1
            boats += 1
        
        return boats
```
