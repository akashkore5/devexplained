## Explanation:
To calculate the total area of all three projections, we need to consider the areas projected onto the xy, yz, and zx planes separately.

### Steps:
1. For the xy-plane projection, the area is the sum of the maximum height of each column in the grid.
2. For the yz-plane projection, the area is the sum of the maximum height of each row in the grid.
3. For the zx-plane projection, the area is the sum of all non-zero values in the grid.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) where n is the size of the grid.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int projectionArea(int[][] grid) {
        int xy = 0, yz = 0, zx = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            int maxRow = 0, maxCol = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) zx++;
                maxRow = Math.max(maxRow, grid[i][j]);
                maxCol = Math.max(maxCol, grid[j][i]);
            }
            xy += maxRow;
            yz += maxCol;
        }
        
        return xy + yz + zx;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int projectionArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int xy = 0, yz = 0, zx = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            int maxRow = 0, maxCol = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) zx++;
                maxRow = max(maxRow, grid[i][j]);
                maxCol = max(maxCol, grid[j][i]);
            }
            xy += maxRow;
            yz += maxCol;
        }
        
        return xy + yz + zx;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def projectionArea(self, grid: List[List[int]) -> int:
        xy = yz = zx = 0
        
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            max_row = max_col = 0
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                if grid[i][j] > 0:
                    zx += 1
                max_row = max(max_row, grid[i][j])
                max_col = max(max_col, grid[j][i])
            xy += max_row
            yz += max_col
        
        return xy + yz + zx
```
