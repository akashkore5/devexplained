## Explanation:
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the minimum number of moves needed to determine the value of `f` with `i` eggs and `j` floors.

For each move, we can either choose to drop an egg from a certain floor `x`:
- If the egg breaks, we have `i-1` eggs remaining and we need to search for `x-1` floors below `x`.
- If the egg does not break, we still have `i` eggs remaining and we need to search for `j-x` floors above `x`.

The optimal strategy is to minimize the worst-case scenario, so we try all possible floor choices from 1 to `j` and take the maximum of the two situations mentioned above for each choice.

The time complexity of this dynamic programming solution is O(k * n^2) and the space complexity is O(k * n).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int superEggDrop(int k, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][n + 1];
        int m = 0;
        while (dp[k][m] < n) {
            m++;
            for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
                dp[i][m] = dp[i][m - 1] + dp[i - 1][m - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return m;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int superEggDrop(int k, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        int m = 0;
        while (dp[k][m] < n) {
            m++;
            for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
                dp[i][m] = dp[i][m - 1] + dp[i - 1][m - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
        return m;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def superEggDrop(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
        m = 0
        while dp[k][m] < n:
            m += 1
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                dp[i][m] = dp[i][m - 1] + dp[i - 1][m - 1] + 1
        return m
