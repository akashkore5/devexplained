## Explanation

To generate a valid n-bit gray code sequence, we can use a backtracking approach. The key idea is to start with 0, then recursively build the sequence by flipping a single bit at a time to create the next number in the sequence. This ensures that adjacent numbers only differ by one bit.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Start with the initial number 0.
2. Generate the next number by flipping a single bit at a time.
3. Keep track of visited numbers to avoid duplicates.
4. Repeat until all possible numbers have been visited.

The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n) since there are 2^n numbers in a valid gray code sequence. The space complexity is O(2^n) to store the result.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int size = result.size();
            for (int j = size - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                result.add(result.get(j) | (1 << i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> result;
        result.push_back(0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int size = result.size();
            for (int j = size - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                result.push_back(result[j] | (1 << i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        result = [0]
        for i in range(n):
            size = len(result)
            for j in range(size - 1, -1, -1):
                result.append(result[j] | (1 << i))
        return result
```
