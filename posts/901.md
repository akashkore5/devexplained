## Explanation
We can solve this problem using a stack to keep track of the previous stock prices and their spans. Whenever a new price is encountered, we pop all the prices that are less than or equal to the current price to calculate the span. The span is the total number of consecutive days we are popping.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty stack to store pairs of prices and spans.
2. For each new price:
   - Initialize the span as 1.
   - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack price is less than or equal to the current price:
     - Pop the stack and add the popped span to the current span.
   - Push the current price and span onto the stack.
3. Return the span of the current price.

## Time Complexity
- Each price is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in O(1) amortized time complexity for each next() call.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of prices seen so far.
```java
class StockSpanner {
    Stack<int[]> stack;
    
    public StockSpanner() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        int span = 1;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek()[0] <= price) {
            span += stack.pop()[1];
        }
        stack.push(new int[]{price, span});
        return span;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class StockSpanner {
public:
    stack<pair<int, int>> prices;
    
    StockSpanner() {
        
    }
    
    int next(int price) {
        int span = 1;
        while (!prices.empty() && prices.top().first <= price) {
            span += prices.top().second;
            prices.pop();
        }
        prices.push({price, span});
        return span;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class StockSpanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        
    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        span = 1
        while self.stack and self.stack[-1][0] <= price:
            span += self.stack.pop()[1]
        self.stack.append((price, span))
        return span
```
