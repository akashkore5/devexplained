## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will keep track of the types of fruits in our two baskets and the count of each type of fruit. We will iterate through the array, adding fruits to our baskets as long as the total number of distinct fruit types in our baskets is less than or equal to 2. If we encounter a third type of fruit, we will update our window by removing fruits from the beginning of the window until we can accommodate the new fruit type. We will keep track of the maximum number of fruits collected during this process.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
Space complexity: O(1)
**Java:**
```java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] fruits) {
        int maxFruits = 0;
        int type1 = -1, type2 = -1, count1 = 0, count2 = 0, current = 0;
        
        for (int fruit : fruits) {
            if (fruit == type1) {
                count1++;
                current++;
            } else if (fruit == type2) {
                count2++;
                current++;
            } else {
                current = count1 + 1;
                count1 = 1;
                type1 = type2;
                count2 = 0;
                type2 = fruit;
            }
            
            if (type1 != -1 && type2 != -1) {
                maxFruits = Math.max(maxFruits, current);
            }
        }
        
        return maxFruits;
    }
}
```

**C++:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        int maxFruits = 0;
        int type1 = -1, type2 = -1, count1 = 0, count2 = 0, current = 0;
        
        for (int fruit : fruits) {
            if (fruit == type1) {
                count1++;
                current++;
            } else if (fruit == type2) {
                count2++;
                current++;
            } else {
                current = count1 + 1;
                count1 = 1;
                type1 = type2;
                count2 = 0;
                type2 = fruit;
            }
            
            if (type1 != -1 && type2 != -1) {
                maxFruits = max(maxFruits, current);
            }
        }
        
        return maxFruits;
    }
};
```

**Python:**
```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        max_fruits = 0
        type1 = -1
        type2 = -1
        count1 = 0
        count2 = 0
        current = 0
        
        for fruit in fruits:
            if fruit == type1:
                count1 += 1
                current += 1
            elif fruit == type2:
                count2 += 1
                current += 1
            else:
                current = count1 + 1
                count1 = 1
                type1 = type2
                count2 = 0
                type2 = fruit
                
            if type1 != -1 and type2 != -1:
                max_fruits = max(max_fruits, current)
        
        return max_fruits
