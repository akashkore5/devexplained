### Explanation:
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a HashMap to keep track of the number of votes each person has received at any given time. We will also maintain a TreeMap to store the total votes for each person at different times.

1. **Constructor (TopVotedCandidate):**
   - Create a HashMap `votesCount` to store the number of votes received by each person.
   - Create a TreeMap `winners` to store the total votes for each person at different times.
   - Iterate through the persons and times arrays to update the votesCount and winners maps.

2. **Query (q):**
   - Use the TreeMap floorEntry() method to find the entry with the largest time value less than or equal to the given time t.
   - Return the person with the most votes at that time.

:

```java
class TopVotedCandidate {
    Map<Integer, Integer> votesCount;
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> winners;
    
    public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
        votesCount = new HashMap<>();
        winners = new TreeMap<>();
        
        int maxVotes = 0;
        int currentWinner = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
            votesCount.put(persons[i], votesCount.getOrDefault(persons[i], 0) + 1);
            int votes = votesCount.get(persons[i]);
            
            if (votes >= maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = votes;
                currentWinner = persons[i];
            }
            
            winners.put(times[i], currentWinner);
        }
    }
    
    public int q(int t) {
        int time = winners.floorKey(t);
        return winners.get(time);
    }
}
```

```cpp
class TopVotedCandidate {
public:
    unordered_map<int, int> votesCount;
    map<int, int> winners;
    
    TopVotedCandidate(vector<int>& persons, vector<int>& times) {
        int maxVotes = 0;
        int currentWinner = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.size(); i++) {
            votesCount[persons[i]]++;
            int votes = votesCount[persons[i]];
            
            if (votes >= maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = votes;
                currentWinner = persons[i];
            }
            
            winners[times[i]] = currentWinner;
        }
    }
    
    int q(int t) {
        auto it = winners.lower_bound(t);
        if (it != winners.begin() && it->first > t)
            it--;
        return it->second;
    }
};
```

```python
class TopVotedCandidate:

    def __init__(self, persons: List[int], times: List[int]):
        self.votes_count = {}
        self.winners = {}
        
        max_votes = 0
        current_winner = -1
        
        for person, time in zip(persons, times):
            self.votes_count[person] = self.votes_count.get(person, 0) + 1
            votes = self.votes_count[person]
            
            if votes >= max_votes:
                max_votes = votes
                current_winner = person
            
            self.winners[time] = current_winner
    
    def q(self, t: int) -> int:
        time = max(time for time in self.winners if time <= t)
        return self.winners[time]
```
