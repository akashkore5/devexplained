## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the counts of all unique integers in the array. If we can find a common divisor greater than 1, then it means we can partition the deck into groups with x cards each, where x is the GCD.

1. Count the occurrences of each unique integer in the deck.
2. Find the GCD of all these counts.
3. If the GCD is greater than 1, return true; otherwise, return false.

**Time Complexity:**
- Counting occurrences: O(n)
- Finding GCD: O(log(min(counts)))

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n) for storing the counts of unique integers
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasGroupsSizeX(int[] deck) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
        for (int card : deck) {
            counts.put(card, counts.getOrDefault(card, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int gcd = 0;
        for (int count : counts.values()) {
            gcd = gcd(gcd, count);
        }
        
        return gcd > 1;
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasGroupsSizeX(vector<int>& deck) {
        unordered_map<int, int> counts;
        for (int card : deck) {
            counts[card]++;
        }
        
        int gcd = 0;
        for (auto count : counts) {
            gcd = findGCD(gcd, count.second);
        }
        
        return gcd > 1;
    }
    
    int findGCD(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : findGCD(b, a % b);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:
        counts = collections.Counter(deck)
        
        def gcd(a, b):
            return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)
        
        result_gcd = 0
        for count in counts.values():
            result_gcd = gcd(result_gcd, count)
        
        return result_gcd > 1
```
