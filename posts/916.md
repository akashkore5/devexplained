### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to find the universal strings from `words1` which contain all the letters present in any word in `words2`. We can achieve this by first finding the counts of each letter in all words in `words2`, then finding the maximum count of each letter across all `words2` words. Finally, we iterate over `words1` and check if each word contains all the letters with counts greater than or equal to the max counts found in `words2`.

#### Algorithm:
1. Create a frequency array for each letter in all words in `words2`.
2. Find the maximum count of each letter across all `words2` words.
3. Iterate over `words1`, for each word:
   - Create a frequency array for the current word.
   - Check if the current word contains all the letters with counts greater than or equal to the max counts found in `words2`.
   - If yes, add the word to the result list.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the total number of characters in `words1` and `words2`, and m is the total number of unique characters in `words2`.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) since the frequency arrays have a constant size of 26 for lowercase English letters.
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> wordSubsets(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int[] maxFreq = new int[26];
        for (String word : words2) {
            int[] freq = new int[26];
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                freq[c - 'a']++;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                maxFreq[i] = Math.max(maxFreq[i], freq[i]);
            }
        }
        
        for (String word : words1) {
            int[] freq = new int[26];
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                freq[c - 'a']++;
            }
            boolean isUniversal = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (freq[i] < maxFreq[i]) {
                    isUniversal = false;
                    break;
