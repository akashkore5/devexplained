## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a dp array where dp[i][j] represents the number of playlists of length i using j different songs. We can then iteratively fill in the dp array by considering the number of ways to choose the next song to add to the playlist.

At each step, we have two choices:
1. If we have not yet reached the goal number of songs, we can add a new song to the playlist. This can be done in (n - j) ways.
2. If we have reached the goal number of songs, we can choose from the songs that have already been played, but we need to ensure that no song repeats until k other songs have been played. This can be done in max(0, j - k) ways.

The final answer is stored in dp[goal][n].

Time complexity: O(n * goal)
Space complexity: O(n * goal)
```java
class Solution {
    public int numMusicPlaylists(int n, int goal, int k) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        long[][] dp = new long[goal + 1][n + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= goal; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - j + 1);
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j] * Math.max(0, j - k);
                dp[i][j] %= mod;
            }
        }

        return (int) dp[goal][n];
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numMusicPlaylists(int n, int goal, int k) {
        long mod = 1000000007;
        vector<vector<long>> dp(goal + 1, vector<long>(n + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= goal; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - j + 1);
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j] * max(0, j - k);
                dp[i][j] %= mod;
            }
        }

        return (int) dp[goal][n];
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numMusicPlaylists(self, n: int, goal: int, k: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(goal + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1

        for i in range(1, goal + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (n - j + 1)
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j] * max(0, j - k)
                dp[i][j] %= mod

        return dp[goal][n]
