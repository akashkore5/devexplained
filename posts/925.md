### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through both the `name` and `typed` strings simultaneously. We keep track of the current characters being compared in both strings. If the characters match, we move to the next characters in both strings. If they don't match, we check if the current character in `typed` is the same as the previous character in `typed`. If it is, this means the current character in `typed` might have been long pressed, so we move to the next character in `typed` and continue comparing. At the end, if we reach the end of both strings, it means the `typed` string can be formed by long-pressing the `name` string.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the longer of the two input strings.  
Space complexity: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (j < typed.length()) {
            if (i < name.length() && name.charAt(i) == typed.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (j > 0 && typed.charAt(j) == typed.charAt(j - 1)) {
                j++;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return i == name.length();
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isLongPressedName(string name, string typed) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (j < typed.length()) {
            if (i < name.length() && name[i] == typed[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (j > 0 && typed[j] == typed[j - 1]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return i == name.length();
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isLongPressedName(self, name: str, typed: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, 0
        while j < len(typed):
            if i < len(name) and name[i] == typed[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif j > 0 and typed[j] == typed[j - 1]:
                j += 1
            else:
                return False
        return i == len(name)
```
