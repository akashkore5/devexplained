## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. We iterate through the binary array `nums`, maintaining a sliding window that keeps track of the sum of elements within the window. At each step, we check if the sum of elements from the start of the window to the current element equals the given `goal`. If it does, we increment the count of subarrays by 1.

Here are the detailed steps:
1. Initialize variables `count` and `sum` to keep track of the count of subarrays and the running sum respectively.
2. Initialize a hashmap `sumCount` to store the frequency of each running sum encountered while iterating through the array.
3. Iterate through the array, adding each element to the running sum.
4. For each sum encountered, check if there exists a `requiredSum` such that `sum - requiredSum = goal`. If such a `requiredSum` is found, increment the count by the frequency of `requiredSum` from the `sumCount` hashmap.
5. Increment the frequency of the current `sum` in the `sumCount` hashmap.
6. Return the final count as the answer.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the input array `nums`, and the space complexity is O(n) as well since we use a hashmap to store the frequency of running sums.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int count = 0, sum = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> sumCount = new HashMap<>();
        sumCount.put(0, 1);
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            int requiredSum = sum - goal;
            count += sumCount.getOrDefault(requiredSum, 0);
            sumCount.put(sum, sumCount.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarraysWithSum(vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        int count = 0, sum = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> sumCount;
        sumCount[0] = 1;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            int requiredSum = sum - goal;
            count += sumCount[requiredSum];
            sumCount[sum]++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        count, sum_val = 0, 0
        sum_count = {0: 1}
        
        for num in nums:
            sum_val += num
            required_sum = sum_val - goal
            count += sum_count.get(required_sum, 0)
            sum_count[sum_val] = sum_count.get(sum_val, 0) + 1
        
        return count
```
