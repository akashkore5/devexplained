### Explanation
To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary search tree (BST). At each node, we check if the node's value falls within the range [low, high]. If it does, we add the node's value to the sum. We then recursively traverse the left and right subtrees if they exist.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the total sum.
2. Perform a recursive DFS traversal starting from the root node.
3. At each node:
   - If the node's value is within the range [low, high], add the value to the `sum`.
   - Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees if they exist.
4. Return the final `sum` value.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary search tree. We visit each node once in the worst case.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary search tree. In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree.

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        
        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) {
            sum += root.val;
        }
        
        sum += rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high);
        sum += rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

#### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        
        if (root->val >= low && root->val <= high) {
            sum += root->val;
        }
        
        sum += rangeSumBST(root->left, low, high);
        sum += rangeSumBST(root->right, low, high);
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

#### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSumBST(self, root: TreeNode, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        total_sum = 0
        
        if low <= root.val <= high:
            total_sum += root.val
        
        total_sum += self.rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high)
        total_sum += self.rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high)
        
        return total_sum
```
