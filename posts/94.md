### Explanation

To perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree iteratively, we can use a stack to simulate the recursive call stack. The basic idea is to start at the root and traverse all the way to the leftmost node, pushing all the nodes encountered along the way onto the stack. Then, we pop nodes from the stack, process them, and move to their right child if it exists. We repeat this process until the stack is empty and all nodes have been processed.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty stack and a list to store the inorder traversal result.
2. Start at the root node and iterate until both the current node and the stack are not empty.
3. While the current node is not null, push it onto the stack and move to its left child.
4. Once the current node becomes null, pop a node from the stack, process it (add its value to the result list), and move to its right child.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the stack is empty.

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case due to the stack used for traversal.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        TreeNode current = root;
        
        while (current != null || !stack.isEmpty()) {
            while (current != null) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current.left;
            }
            current = stack.pop();
            result.add(current.val);
            current = current.right;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        stack<TreeNode*> stack;
        TreeNode* current = root;
        
        while (current != nullptr || !stack.empty()) {
            while (current != nullptr) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current->left;
            }
            current = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            result.push_back(current->val);
            current = current->right;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        stack = []
        current = root
        
        while current or stack:
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
            current = stack.pop()
            result.append(current.val)
            current = current.right
            
        return result
```
