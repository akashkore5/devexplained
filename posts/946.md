### Explanation
We can simulate the process of pushing and popping elements onto a stack based on the given `pushed` and `popped` arrays. We iterate through the `pushed` array, pushing elements onto a stack one by one. After pushing each element, we check if the top element of the stack is the same as the next element to be popped. If they match, we pop the element from the stack. Finally, if the stack is empty after processing all elements, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the `pushed` array:
    - Push the element onto the stack.
    - While the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is equal to the next element to be popped:
        - Pop the element from the stack.
3. If the stack is empty after processing all elements, return true; otherwise, return false.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the pushed array. We iterate through each element once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the pushed array. We use a stack to store elements.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int i = 0;
        for (int num : pushed) {
            stack.push(num);
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && i < popped.length && stack.peek() == popped[i]) {
                stack.pop();
                i++;
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        stack<int> st;
        int i = 0;
        for (int num : pushed) {
            st.push(num);
            while (!st.empty() && i < popped.size() && st.top() == popped[i]) {
                st.pop();
                i++;
            }
        }
        return st.empty();
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        stack = []
        i = 0
        for num in pushed:
            stack.append(num)
            while stack and i < len(popped) and stack[-1] == popped[i]:
                stack.pop()
                i += 1
        return not stack
```
