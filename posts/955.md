### Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of columns that need to be deleted in order to make all strings sorted lexicographically. We can achieve this by iterating through each column and checking if the current column violates the lexicographic order. If a violation is found, we increment a counter representing the number of columns that need to be deleted.

- Initialize a counter variable to 0.
- Iterate through each column.
- Check if the current column violates the lexicographic order.
- If a violation is found, increment the counter.
- Return the counter as the minimum number of columns to be deleted.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * m) where n is the number of strings and m is the length of each string.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int col = 0; col < strs[0].length(); col++) {
            for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
                if (strs[i - 1].charAt(col) > strs[i].charAt(col)) {
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int col = 0; col < strs[0].size(); col++) {
            for (int i = 1; i < strs.size(); i++) {
                if (strs[i - 1][col] > strs[i][col]) {
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for col in range(len(strs[0])):
            for i in range(1, len(strs)):
                if strs[i - 1][col] > strs[i][col]:
                    count += 1
                    break
        return count
```
