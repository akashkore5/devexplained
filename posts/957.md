### Explanation
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the state changes of the prison cells for `n` days according to the given rules. We can optimize this process by observing that the state of the prison cells will start repeating after a certain number of days, which can help us avoid unnecessary iterations.

1. We can store the state of the prison cells after each day in a hashmap or a set.
2. If we encounter a state that we have seen before, it means we have reached a cycle and we can calculate the remaining days using modulo arithmetic.
3. After finding the cycle length, we can directly calculate the state of the prison cells after `n` days.

**Time Complexity:** O(2^N) - In the worst case, we might need to iterate through all possible states before finding a cycle, where N is the number of cells.

**Space Complexity:** O(2^N) - In the worst case, we might need to store all possible states before finding a cycle.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int n) {
        Map<String, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        boolean hasCycle = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int[] next = new int[8];
            String cellStr = Arrays.toString(cells);
            if (seen.containsKey(cellStr)) {
                int cycleLength = i - seen.get(cellStr);
                int remainingDays = (n - i) % cycleLength;
                return prisonAfterNDays(cells, remainingDays);
            } else {
                seen.put(cellStr, i);
                for (int j = 1; j < 7; j++) {
                    next[j] = cells[j - 1] == cells[j + 1] ? 1 : 0;
                }
                cells = next;
            }
        }
        
        return cells;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& cells, int n) {
        unordered_map<string, int> seen;
        bool hasCycle = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            vector<int> next(8, 0);
            string cellStr = "";
            for (int cell : cells) {
                cellStr += to_string(cell);
            }
            
            if (seen.find(cellStr) != seen.end()) {
                int cycleLength = i - seen[cellStr];
                int remainingDays = (n - i) % cycleLength;
                return prisonAfterNDays(cells, remainingDays);
            } else {
                seen[cellStr] = i;
                for (int j = 1; j < 7; j++) {
                    next[j] = cells[j - 1] == cells[j + 1] ? 1 : 0;
                }
                cells = next;
            }
        }
        
        return cells;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def prisonAfterNDays(self, cells: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        
        for i in range(n):
            next_cells = [0] * 8
            cell_str = str(cells)
            
            if cell_str in seen:
                cycle_length = i - seen[cell_str]
                remaining_days = (n - i) % cycle_length
                return self.prisonAfterNDays(cells, remaining_days)
            else:
                seen[cell_str] = i
                for j in range(1, 7):
                    next_cells[j] = 1 if cells[j - 1] == cells[j + 1] else 0
                cells = next_cells
        
        return cells
```

This solution efficiently handles the state changes of the prison cells for `n` days by identifying cycles and optimizing the process.
