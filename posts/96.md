## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The problem can be approached by defining a function `numTrees(n)` that represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes. We can use the following recurrence relation:

`numTrees(n) = numTrees(0)*numTrees(n-1) + numTrees(1)*numTrees(n-2) + ... + numTrees(k)*numTrees(n-k-1) + ... + numTrees(n-1)*numTrees(0)`

The base case is `numTrees(0) = 1` and `numTrees(1) = 1`.

We can maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes. We then iterate over all possible numbers of nodes from `1` to `n` and calculate the number of unique BSTs using the above recurrence relation.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) as we iterate over all numbers from `1` to `n` and calculate the number of unique BSTs.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) to store the array `dp`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
        
        return dp[n]
```
