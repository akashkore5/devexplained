### Explanation:
- We can solve this problem by using a hash set to keep track of unique elements encountered so far.
- As we iterate through the array, if we encounter an element that already exists in the set, it means we have found the repeated element.
- We return this repeated element as the final result.

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (set.contains(num)) {
                return num;
            }
            set.add(num);
        }
        return -1; // Not found, should not reach here
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (set.find(num) != set.end()) {
                return num;
            }
            set.insert(num);
        }
        return -1; // Not found, should not reach here
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return num
            seen.add(num)
        return -1  # Not found, should not reach here
```
