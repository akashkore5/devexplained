## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can use a min heap (priority queue) to store the points based on their distance from the origin. We will calculate the Euclidean distance for each point and insert it into the min heap. We then pop the top k elements from the heap to get the k closest points to the origin.

- Create a min heap to store points based on their distance from the origin
- Calculate the distance for each point and insert it into the min heap
- Pop the top k elements from the heap to get the k closest points

Time complexity: O(n log k) where n is the number of points
Space complexity: O(k)
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (b[0] * b[0] + b[1] * b[1]) - (a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1]));

        for (int[] point : points) {
            minHeap.offer(point);
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.poll();
            }
        }

        int[][] result = new int[k][2];
        int i = 0;
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            result[i] = minHeap.poll();
            i++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        auto cmp = [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return (a[0]*a[0] + a[1]*a[1]) < (b[0]*b[0] + b[1]*b[1]);
        };
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, decltype(cmp)> minHeap(cmp);

        for (vector<int>& point : points) {
            minHeap.push(point);
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.pop();
            }
        }

        vector<vector<int>> result(k, vector<int>(2));
        int i = k - 1;
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            result[i] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            i--;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        minHeap = []
        
        for point in points:
            distance = point[0] ** 2 + point[1] ** 2
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, (-distance, point))
            if len(minHeap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        
        result = [point for (_, point) in minHeap]
        
        return result
```
