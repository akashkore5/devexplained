## Explanation

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of prefix sums. We iterate through the array and keep track of the running sum and the count of subarrays with a sum divisible by k. We can use a HashMap to store the count of different remainders when dividing the running sum by k. If at any point, we encounter a remainder that we have seen before, it means there is a subarray with a sum divisible by k. We increment the count by the number of times we have seen that remainder.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a HashMap `remainderCount` with initial value (0, 1) to consider an empty subarray at the start.
2. Initialize variables `runningSum` and `count` to keep track of running sum and count of subarrays.
3. Iterate through the array and calculate the running sum.
4. Calculate the remainder of `runningSum` when divided by `k`.
5. If the remainder is negative, add `k` to make it positive.
6. If `remainderCount` contains the remainder, increment `count` by the value in `remainderCount` for that remainder.
7. Update the count of the current remainder in `remainderCount`.
8. Return the final count.

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
**Space Complexity:** O(k), where k is the value of the input k.
```java
class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> remainderCount = new HashMap<>();
        remainderCount.put(0, 1);
        int runningSum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            runningSum += num;
            int remainder = runningSum % k;
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += k;
            }
            if (remainderCount.containsKey(remainder)) {
                count += remainderCount.get(remainder);
            }
            remainderCount.put(remainder, remainderCount.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> remainderCount;
        remainderCount[0] = 1;
        int runningSum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            runningSum += num;
            int remainder = runningSum % k;
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += k;
            }
            if (remainderCount.find(remainder) != remainderCount.end()) {
                count += remainderCount[remainder];
            }
            remainderCount[remainder]++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysDivByK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        remainderCount = {0: 1}
        runningSum = 0
        count = 0

        for num in nums:
            runningSum += num
            remainder = runningSum % k
            if remainder < 0:
                remainder += k
            if remainder in remainderCount:
                count += remainderCount[remainder]
            remainderCount[remainder] = remainderCount.get(remainder, 0) + 1

        return count
```
