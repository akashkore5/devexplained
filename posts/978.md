## Explanation
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the current turbulent subarray's length. We will maintain two variables: `up` to track the length of the current increasing subarray ending at the current index, and `down` to track the length of the current decreasing subarray ending at the current index. We will update these variables based on the comparison of the current element with the previous one.

At each step, we update the length of the turbulent subarray by taking the maximum of `up` and `down` and then reset the appropriate variable based on the comparison of the current element with the previous one.

Finally, we return the maximum turbulent subarray length found during the iteration.

Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
Space complexity: O(1)
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTurbulenceSize(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int up = 1, down = 1, maxLen = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i - 1] < arr[i]) {
                down = up + 1;
                up = 1;
            } else if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) {
                up = down + 1;
                down = 1;
            } else {
                up = 1;
                down = 1;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, Math.max(up, down));
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTurbulenceSize(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int up = 1, down = 1, maxLen = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i - 1] < arr[i]) {
                down = up + 1;
                up = 1;
            } else if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) {
                up = down + 1;
                down = 1;
            } else {
                up = 1;
                down = 1;
            }

            maxLen = max(maxLen, max(up, down));
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxTurbulenceSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        up = 1
        down = 1
        max_len = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i - 1] < arr[i]:
                down = up + 1
                up = 1
            elif arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:
                up = down + 1
                down = 1
            else:
                up = 1
                down = 1

            max_len = max(max_len, max(up, down))

        return max_len
