### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can perform a post-order traversal of the binary tree and calculate the excess coins at each node. The excess at a node represents the number of coins that need to be moved in or out of that node to balance it. We can accumulate the total number of moves required as we traverse the tree.

1. At each node, we calculate the excess coins as `node.val - 1`. This excess can be "given" to the parent node or "taken" from the parent node.
2. We recursively calculate the excess at the left and right children of the current node.
3. The total moves required for the current node is the absolute value of the sum of excess coins at the current node and its children.
4. Finally, we return the total moves required to balance the entire tree.

Time Complexity: O(n) - We visit each node exactly once during the post-order traversal.
Space Complexity: O(n) - The recursion stack can go up to the depth of the binary tree.

:

```java
class Solution {
    int moves = 0;
    
    public int distributeCoins(TreeNode root) {
        postOrder(root);
        return moves;
    }
    
    private int postOrder(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = postOrder(node.left);
        int right = postOrder(node.right);
        
        moves += Math.abs(left) + Math.abs(right);
        
        return node.val + left + right - 1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int moves = 0;
    
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        postOrder(root);
        return moves;
    }
    
    int postOrder(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = postOrder(node->left);
        int right = postOrder(node->right);
        
        moves += abs(left) + abs(right);
        
        return node->val + left + right - 1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.moves = 0
    
    def distributeCoins(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.postOrder(root)
        return self.moves
    
    def postOrder(self, node: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not node:
            return 0
        
        left = self.postOrder(node.left)
        right = self.postOrder(node.right)
        
        self.moves += abs(left) + abs(right)
        
        return node.val + left + right - 1
```
