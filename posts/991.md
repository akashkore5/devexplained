## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the target to the startValue. At each step, we choose either to divide by 2 or add 1 based on whether the current number is even or odd. By doing this, we can reach the startValue from the target. The number of operations needed will be the minimum steps taken.

## Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate while `target` is greater than `startValue`:
   - If `target` is even, divide it by 2.
   - If `target` is odd, increment it by 1.
   - Increment `result` by 1.
3. Add the difference between `startValue` and `target` to `result`.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(target)).

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1).

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int result = 0;
        while (target > startValue) {
            if (target % 2 == 0) {
                target /= 2;
            } else {
                target++;
            }
            result++;
        }
        return result + startValue - target;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int result = 0;
        while (target > startValue) {
            if (target % 2 == 0) {
                target /= 2;
            } else {
                target++;
            }
            result++;
        }
        return result + startValue - target;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, startValue: int, target: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        while target > startValue:
            if target % 2 == 0:
                target //= 2
            else:
                target += 1
            result += 1
        return result + startValue - target
```
