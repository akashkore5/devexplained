## Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can create two arrays: `trustCount` and `isTrusted`. The `trustCount` array will store the count of people trusting each person, and the `isTrusted` array will store whether a person trusts someone or not. 

We will iterate through the `trust` array and update these arrays. After that, we will check for the person who is trusted by all others (trustCount[i] == n-1) and doesn't trust anyone (isTrusted[i] == false). This person will be considered as the town judge. If there is no such person, we return -1.

- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of people in the town.
- Space complexity: O(N) for the two arrays.

:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] trustCount = new int[n+1];
        boolean[] isTrusted = new boolean[n+1];
        
        for (int[] t : trust) {
            int a = t[0];
            int b = t[1];
            trustCount[b]++;
            isTrusted[a] = true;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trustCount[i] == n-1 && !isTrusted[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> trustCount(n+1, 0);
        vector<bool> isTrusted(n+1, false);
        
        for (auto t : trust) {
            int a = t[0];
            int b = t[1];
            trustCount[b]++;
            isTrusted[a] = true;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trustCount[i] == n-1 && !isTrusted[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        trustCount = [0] * (n+1)
        isTrusted = [False] * (n+1)
        
        for t in trust:
            a, b = t
            trustCount[b] += 1
            isTrusted[a] = True
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if trustCount[i] == n-1 and not isTrusted[i]:
                return i
        
        return -1
```
