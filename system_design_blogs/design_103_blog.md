**Design a Real-time Pollution Monitoring System**

**Introduction**
In this document, we will explore the design of a system for real-time pollution monitoring. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

**Requirements**
### Functional Requirements
The system must provide core functionalities, including:

* Real-time air quality monitoring: Collecting data on pollutant levels, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
* Data processing and analysis: Processing sensor data to generate insights on pollution patterns and trends.
* Alert and notification systems: Sending alerts and notifications to authorities and citizens in case of hazardous air quality conditions.

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Providing real-time air quality information to the public through a mobile app or website.
* Sending automated alerts to city officials when pollutant levels exceed safety thresholds.
* Analyzing data to identify pollution hotspots and recommend areas for improvement.

### Non-Functional Requirements
The system must also meet performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes, such as:

* High availability: The system should be available 99.9% of the time to ensure continuous monitoring and alerting.
* Fast response times: Users should receive real-time updates within seconds or minutes of data collection.
* Scalability: The system should handle increased traffic and sensor data without compromising performance.

**High-Level Architecture**
The system architecture consists of several key components:

* **Sensor Network**: A network of air quality sensors installed across the city to collect real-time data.
* **Data Processing Platform**: A cloud-based platform responsible for processing and analyzing sensor data.
* **API Gateway**: A RESTful API that handles incoming requests, routes them to the correct services, and returns responses to clients.
* **Alerting System**: A notification system that sends alerts and notifications based on predetermined thresholds.

**Database Schema**
The database schema consists of three main tables:

1. **Sensor Readings**: Stores real-time sensor data, including pollutant levels, temperature, humidity, and timestamp.
2. **Air Quality Zones**: Maps sensors to specific geographic areas (e.g., streets, neighborhoods) for easy querying.
3. **Alert Histories**: Logs all alerts sent, including timestamp, severity, and relevant details.

**API Design**
### Key Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

* `GET /air-quality`: Returns current air quality data for a specified location.
* `POST /alerts`: Sends an alert notification to authorities and citizens based on predefined thresholds.
* `GET /stats`: Returns aggregated statistics on pollution patterns and trends.

Example requests and responses:
```json
// GET /air-quality?location=New+York
{
  "location": "New York",
  "pollutant_levels": {
    "PM2.5": 12,
    "NO2": 10
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-02-20T14:30:00Z"
}

// POST /alerts?threshold=100&location=Los+Angeles
{
  "message": "Air quality in Los Angeles has exceeded the threshold (PM2.5: 150)",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "timestamp": "2023-02-20T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### OpenAPI Specification

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2

  title: Air Quality Monitoring API
  description: Real-time air quality monitoring and alerting system
paths:
  /air-quality:
    get:
      summary: Get current air quality data for a location
      parameters:
        - name: location
          in: query
          type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Air quality data response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AirQualityData'
  /alerts:
    post:
      summary: Send an alert notification
      parameters:
        - name: threshold
          in: query
          type: integer
        - name: location
          in: query
          type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: Alert response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Alert'
```

**System Flow**
The system flow involves the following steps:

1. Sensors collect real-time data on air quality and environmental factors.
2. The API gateway receives requests from clients and routes them to the correct services (e.g., data processing, alerting).
3. The data processing platform processes sensor data, generates insights, and stores them in the database.
4. The alerting system checks for predefined thresholds and sends notifications when conditions are met.

**Challenges and Solutions**
Potential challenges:

* Integrating with existing infrastructure and sensors
* Handling increased traffic and sensor data without compromising performance
* Ensuring security and data integrity

Solutions:

* Partner with existing sensor manufacturers to integrate their devices
* Implement load balancing, caching, and queuing mechanisms to handle increased traffic
* Use encryption and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit

**Scalability and Performance**
To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance:

* Scale horizontally by adding more instances of the API gateway, data processing platform, and alerting system.
* Implement load balancing and caching mechanisms to distribute traffic and reduce latency.
* Monitor system performance regularly and adjust settings or add new infrastructure as needed.

**Security Considerations**
To protect the system and its data:

* Use encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) for all data in transit.
* Implement secure protocols (e.g., OAuth, JWT) for authentication and authorization.
* Regularly update software and firmware to ensure security patches are applied.
