**Design a Real-time Air Traffic Control System**

## Introduction

As the world becomes increasingly dependent on air travel, the need for efficient and reliable air traffic control systems has never been more pressing. In this document, we will explore the design of a real-time air traffic control system, examining the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide include:

* Real-time tracking of aircraft positions and trajectories
* Automated collision avoidance systems (ACAS) to prevent mid-air collisions
* Air traffic controllers' interfaces for monitoring and controlling air traffic
* Integration with weather services and NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen)

Specific use cases or scenarios may include:

* Handling unexpected changes in flight plans due to weather or mechanical issues
* Coordinating with neighboring air traffic control centers to ensure safe separations

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, such as:

* Performance: respond quickly to changing situations and provide timely updates
* Scalability: handle increasing numbers of aircraft and controllers without performance degradation
* Reliability: maintain high availability and minimize downtime for maintenance or upgrades
* Security: protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of air traffic control decisions

## High-Level Architecture

The system's architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Air Traffic Control Center**: responsible for monitoring and controlling air traffic, receiving flight plans, and issuing clearances.
2. **Aircraft Tracking System**: uses radar and satellite data to track aircraft positions and trajectories in real-time.
3. **Automated Collision Avoidance System (ACAS)**: analyzes detected collisions and issues alerts to controllers to take evasive action.
4. **Weather Services**: provides real-time weather forecasts, NOTAMs, and other relevant information for air traffic control decisions.

These components interact as follows:

* Air Traffic Control Center receives flight plans and issues clearances
* Aircraft Tracking System tracks aircraft positions and trajectories
* ACAS detects potential collisions and alerts controllers
* Weather Services provides weather data and NOTAMs to inform air traffic control decisions

                  |
                  | (provides weather data and NOTAMs)
```

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Aircraft**: stores aircraft information, including flight plans and current positions.
2. **Air Traffic Controllers**: stores controller information, including assignments and availability.
3. **Weather Data**: stores real-time weather forecasts and NOTAMs.
4. **Flight Plans**: stores flight plan data, including departure and arrival airports.

**Relationships:**

* Aircraft is linked to Flight Plans through the aircraft's current flight plan.
* Air Traffic Controllers are linked to Aircraft through controller assignments.
* Weather Data is linked to Flight Plans and Aircraft through weather forecasts and NOTAMs.

**Indexing Strategies:**

* Create indexes on Aircraft.icao_id and Flight Plans.flight_plan_id for efficient querying.
* Create an index on Weather Data.timestamp for quick lookups of current weather data.

## API Design

### Key Endpoints:

1. **Get Aircraft Positions**: returns the current positions and trajectories of all aircraft
2. **Get Flight Plans**: retrieves a specific flight plan or all flight plans for a given air traffic controller
3. **Issue Clearance**: updates an aircraft's clearance status and sends notifications to controllers

## System Flow

The system flow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Air Traffic Control Center receives flight plans and issues clearances.
2. Aircraft Tracking System tracks aircraft positions and trajectories in real-time.
3. ACAS detects potential collisions and alerts controllers to take evasive action.
4. Weather Services provides weather data and NOTAMs to inform air traffic control decisions.
