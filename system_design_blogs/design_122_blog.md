**Design a Virtual Reality Escape Room**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Virtual Reality Escape Room". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The virtual reality escape room system must provide the following core functionalities:

* Allow users to create their own escape rooms with custom puzzles, riddles, and challenges
* Enable users to share and collaborate on escape rooms with friends or strangers
* Provide a virtual reality experience that simulates an immersive environment for players to interact with

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A group of friends creating and solving an escape room together
* A family member designing an escape room for a birthday party
* A corporate team-building event using the escape room as a bonding activity

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, including:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of users and minimize lag or latency
* Scalability: The system should be able to scale up or down to accommodate changes in user demand
* Reliability: The system should be designed to minimize downtime and ensure high availability

### High-Level Architecture

The virtual reality escape room system will consist of the following key components:

* **User Interface**: A web-based interface for users to create, share, and play escape rooms
* **Game Engine**: A software engine that simulates the virtual reality environment and handles game logic
* **Database**: A database that stores user-created content, game state, and player interactions
* **API Gateway**: An API gateway that manages incoming requests from clients and directs them to the appropriate components

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:

```
          +---------------+
          |  User Interface  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (requests)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  API Gateway    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (routes requests)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Game Engine     |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (simulates VR environment)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database        |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (stores user-created content, game state, and player interactions)
```

### Database Schema

The database schema will consist of the following tables:

* **Users**: stores information about registered users, including usernames, passwords, and preferences
* **Rooms**: stores information about created escape rooms, including title, description, and puzzle/challenge details
* **Puzzles**: stores individual puzzles or challenges within a room, along with solution hints and reward mechanics
* **Player Progress**: tracks player progress through each room, including completed puzzles and earned rewards

The following diagram illustrates the database schema:

```
          +---------------+
          |  Users        |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (username, password, preferences)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Rooms       |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (title, description, puzzle/challenge details)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Puzzles      |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (puzzle text, solution hint, reward mechanics)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Player Progress|
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (player ID, room ID, completed puzzles, earned rewards)
```

### API Design

The system will provide the following key endpoints:

* **Create Room**: allows users to create a new escape room with custom puzzles and challenges
* **Join Room**: enables users to join an existing escape room and start playing
* **Solve Puzzle**: submits user input for a specific puzzle or challenge, returning hints or rewards if solved correctly

Example requests and responses include:

```
POST /create-room
{
  "title": "My First Escape Room",
  "description": "A beginner's escape room with basic puzzles"
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "room_id": 12345,
  "puzzles": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "What am I?",
      "hint": "You can find me in the kitchen"
    }
  ]
}

GET /join-room
{
  "room_id": 12345,
  "player_name": "John Doe",
  "puzzles": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "What am I?",
      "hint": "You can find me in the kitchen"
    }
  ]
}

POST /solve-puzzle
{
  "room_id": 12345,

}

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "hint": "You're getting close!",
  "reward": "10 points"
}
```

### OpenAPI Specification

The system will use the OpenAPI specification to document its APIs.

**OpenAPI Spec**

```
swagger: "2.0"
info:
  title: Virtual Reality Escape Room API
  description: A RESTful API for creating, sharing, and playing escape rooms in virtual reality
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /create-room:
    post:
      summary: Create a new escape room with custom puzzles and challenges
      consumes:
        - application/json
      parameters:
        - in: body
          name: room
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              title:
                type: string
              description:
                type: string
              puzzles:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                    text:
                      type: string
                    hint:
                      type: string
```

### System Flow

The system flow will involve the following components and interactions:

* Users create a new escape room with custom puzzles and challenges using the user interface.
* The API gateway receives the request, validates the data, and directs it to the game engine.
* The game engine simulates the virtual reality environment, loads the room's puzzles and challenges, and starts playing.
* Players interact with the puzzles and challenges, submitting input for each puzzle or challenge.
* The game engine checks player input against the correct solution, providing hints or rewards if solved correctly.
* Player progress is tracked in the database, allowing for leaderboards and rewards.
