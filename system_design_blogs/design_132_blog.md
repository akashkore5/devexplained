**Design a Smart Traffic Signal Optimization System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for optimizing traffic signals in urban areas. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The system must provide the following core functionalities:

* Monitor real-time traffic conditions using sensors and cameras
* Analyze traffic patterns and predict future congestion hotspots
* Optimize traffic signal timing to minimize congestion and reduce travel times
* Integrate with existing infrastructure, including traffic lights and road signs
* Provide real-time data and analytics for city planners and transportation authorities

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Rush hour traffic optimization to reduce congestion and improve safety
* Special event planning (e.g., sports games or festivals) to minimize traffic disruptions
* Emergency response optimization during accidents or natural disasters

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must meet the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: respond to requests within 500ms
* Scalability: handle a minimum of 10,000 concurrent users
* Reliability: maintain a uptime of at least 99.5%
* Security: protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access

## High-Level Architecture

The system's architecture consists of the following key components:

* **Sensor Network**: A network of sensors and cameras monitoring real-time traffic conditions
* **Data Processing**: A processing engine analyzing sensor data and predicting future congestion hotspots
* **Optimization Engine**: An optimization algorithm optimizing traffic signal timing based on predicted traffic patterns
* **Integration Layer**: A layer integrating with existing infrastructure, including traffic lights and road signs
* **Analytics Platform**: A platform providing real-time data and analytics for city planners and transportation authorities

The architecture is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure. The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:
```

          |  Sensor Network  |
          +---------------+
                  |

                  |
                  |  Analytics Platform
          +---------------+
```
## Database Schema

The system's database schema consists of the following tables:

* **Sensor Readings**: storing real-time sensor data, including timestamp, location, and traffic conditions
* **Traffic Patterns**: storing historical traffic patterns and predictions for future congestion hotspots

The following diagram illustrates the database schema:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Sensor Readings  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Traffic Patterns
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Signal Timing
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Infrastructure Integration
          +---------------+
```
## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The system provides the following key endpoints:

* `GET /traffic`: returns real-time traffic conditions and predictions for future congestion hotspots
* `POST /optimize`: optimizes traffic signal timing based on predicted traffic patterns
* `GET /infrastructure`: retrieves integration details with existing infrastructure

Example requests and responses:
```
  Request: GET /traffic
  Response: {
    "timestamp": 1643723400,
    "location": "Main St",
    "traffic_conditions": ["heavy", "congested"]
  }

  Request: POST /optimize
  Response: {
    "optimized_signal_timing": [
      {"time": 1643723400, "green_light_time": 10},
      {"time": 1643723500, "red_light_time": 30}
    ]
  }
```
### OpenAPI Specification

The system uses OpenAPI specification version 3.0. The following is an example of the OpenAPI spec:
