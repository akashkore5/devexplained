**Design a Real-time Weather Prediction System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for predicting real-time weather conditions. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

* Provide accurate and up-to-date weather predictions for a specific geographic region
* Allow users to input their location and receive personalized weather forecasts
* Offer alerts for severe weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, strong winds)
* Support multiple languages and currencies

#### Non-Functional Requirements

* High performance: respond quickly to user requests and update weather data in real-time
* Scalability: handle a large number of users and traffic without compromising performance
* Reliability: ensure the system is always available and data is accurate and trustworthy
* Security: protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure transactions

### High-Level Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: responsible for collecting weather data from various sources (e.g., satellite imagery, radar, ground stations) and storing it in a centralized database.
2. **Predictive Model**: uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the collected data and generate real-time weather predictions.
3. **API Gateway**: provides a unified interface for users to interact with the system, handling API requests and responses.
4. **Web Interface**: allows users to input their location, view current weather conditions, and receive personalized forecasts.

### Database Schema

The system uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the following tables:

* **weather_data**: stores historical and real-time weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed)
* **locations**: stores geographic locations and their corresponding coordinates
* **predictions**: stores predicted weather conditions for each location
* **users**: stores user information and preferences

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

1. `GET /weather/{location}`: returns the current weather condition for a given location
2. `GET /forecast/{location}`: returns a 3-hour forecast for a given location
3. `POST /alert`: allows users to set custom alerts for severe weather conditions

#### OpenAPI Specification (OAS)

                format: int32
              humidity:
                type: number
                format: float
              wind_speed:
                type: integer
                format: int32
```

### System Flow

The system flow can be summarized as follows:

1. A user inputs their location and requests weather data.
2. The API gateway processes the request and queries the predictive model for the current weather condition.
3. The predictive model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time weather data, generating a prediction.
4. The API gateway returns the predicted weather condition to the user.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Data Quality**: ensure that collected weather data is accurate and reliable.
	* Solution: implement data quality checks and validation procedures.
2. **Scalability**: handle increased traffic and user requests without compromising performance.
	* Solution: use load balancing, caching, and scalable infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing).
3. **Security**: protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
	* Solution: implement robust security measures (e.g., encryption, authentication, authorization).

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased traffic and maintain performance:

1. Use load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
2. Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of database queries.
3. Utilize scalable infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing) for improved scalability.

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**: encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user information, weather predictions).
	* Solution: use industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols.
2. **Access Control**: implement robust access control measures to prevent unauthorized access.
	* Solution: use authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
