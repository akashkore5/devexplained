**Design a Smart City Waste Collection System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for a Smart City Waste Collection System. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide include:

* Real-time tracking of waste collection vehicles and their routes
* Automated reporting of waste collection activities
* Integration with waste management facilities for efficient processing
* User interface for citizens to report issues and request collections

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Implementing a smart waste collection system in a city with high population density
* Integrating the system with existing waste management infrastructure

#### Non-Functional Requirements

Performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes are crucial in designing this system. The system must:

* Handle a large number of concurrent requests without degradation
* Provide real-time updates to citizens and waste management facilities
* Ensure data integrity and security

### High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture of the Smart City Waste Collection System consists of the following components:

* **Waste Management Facility Interface**: responsible for integrating with existing waste management infrastructure
* **Data Analytics Engine**: processes sensor data from waste collection vehicles and provides insights on waste collection efficiency
* **Mobile App**: allows citizens to report issues and request collections
* **Web Portal**: provides real-time updates to citizens and waste management facilities

### Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Waste_Vehicles | stores information about waste collection vehicles, including location and route data |
| Waste_Collections | tracks waste collection activities, including date, time, and quantity collected |
| Reports | stores citizen-reported issues and requests for collections |

Relationships between tables include:

* A waste vehicle can have multiple routes
* A route can have multiple waste collection activities
* A report is associated with a specific location and waste collection activity

Indexing strategies:

* Primary key on Waste_Vehicles table: unique identifier for each vehicle
* Index on Waste_Collections table: date and time of collection to facilitate efficient querying

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

The system provides the following APIs:

* **GET /waste_vehicles**: retrieves a list of waste collection vehicles
* **POST /reports**: submits a report from a citizen
* **GET /collections**: retrieves a list of waste collection activities

Example requests and responses:

* `GET /waste_vehicles`: Returns a JSON response with the list of waste collection vehicles, including their locations and routes.
* `POST /reports`: Accepts a JSON request with the report details (e.g., location, issue description) and returns a success message.

### OpenAPI Specification

Here is an example OpenAPI spec for the APIs:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Smart City Waste Collection System API
  description: Provides access to waste collection vehicle data and reporting functionality
paths:
  /waste_vehicles:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of waste collection vehicles
      responses:
        200:
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/WasteVehicle'
  /reports:
    post:
      summary: Submit a report from a citizen
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                location:
                  type: string
                issue_description:
                  type: string
        description: Submit a report with the given details
      responses:
        201:
          description: Report submitted successfully
```
### System Flow

The system flow involves the following steps:

1. A citizen reports an issue or requests a collection through the mobile app or web portal.
2. The report is processed by the Data Analytics Engine, which determines the location and type of issue.
3. The Data Analytics Engine sends the report to the Waste Management Facility Interface for processing.
4. The Waste Management Facility Interface updates the waste management facility's database with the report details.
5. The system provides real-time updates to citizens and waste management facilities through the Web Portal.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing this system include:

* Scalability: handling a large number of concurrent requests without degradation
	+ Solution: implement load balancing and caching mechanisms
* Security: protecting sensitive data and ensuring data integrity
	+ Solution: implement encryption, access controls, and regular backups

### Scalability and Performance

Strategies to ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance include:

* Load balancing: distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval
* Horizontal scaling: add more servers as needed to increase processing capacity

### Security Considerations

Security measures to protect the system and its data include:

* Encryption: secure data transmission using protocols like HTTPS
* Access controls: restrict access to sensitive data and functionality
* Regular backups: ensure data integrity in case of unexpected events

### ASCII Diagrams

Simple ASCII diagrams can be used to illustrate the architecture or workflows. For example:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Waste      |
          |  Management  |
          |  Facility    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Reports
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Data Analytics|
          |  Engine        |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Web Portal
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Mobile App   |
          |  (Citizen)    |
          +---------------+
```
### Sample SQL Schema

Here is an example SQL script for creating the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Waste_Vehicles (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  route_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE Waste_Collections (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  date DATE,
  time TIME,
  quantity INT,
  waste_vehicle_id INT
    FOREIGN KEY (waste_vehicle_id) REFERENCES Waste_Vehicles(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Reports (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  issue_description TEXT,
  reported_by VARCHAR(255)
);
```
