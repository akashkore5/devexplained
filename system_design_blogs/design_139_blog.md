**Design a Real-time Wildlife Migration Tracker**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for tracking wildlife migrations in real-time. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide include:

* Real-time data collection from sensors and cameras installed along migration routes
* Data processing and analysis to identify patterns and trends in wildlife migrations
* Visualization of migration patterns and animal behavior through interactive maps and dashboards
* Alerts and notifications for conservationists, researchers, and stakeholders about significant events or changes in wildlife populations

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet the following non-functional requirements:

* Scalability: handle increased load and traffic from multiple sources
* Performance: process data quickly and efficiently to provide real-time insights
* Reliability: ensure data integrity and accuracy through redundant systems and backup processes
* Security: protect sensitive information about wildlife populations, habitats, and conservation efforts

## High-Level Architecture

The system's architecture will consist of the following key components:

* **Sensor Network**: a network of sensors and cameras installed along migration routes to collect real-time data on wildlife movements and behavior.
* **Data Processing**: a processing engine that analyzes and filters the raw sensor data to extract meaningful insights about wildlife migrations.
* **Database**: a database that stores processed data, user preferences, and system configurations.
* **Visualization Platform**: an interactive platform that provides visualizations of migration patterns and animal behavior through maps and dashboards.
* **Alerts and Notifications**: a system for sending alerts and notifications to conservationists, researchers, and stakeholders about significant events or changes in wildlife populations.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:
```

       |
       |  Visualize
       v
+---------------+
|  Alerts and Notifications  |
+---------------+
```
## Database Schema

The database schema will consist of the following tables:

* **Sensor_Data**: stores raw sensor data, including timestamp, location, and animal ID.
* **Migration_Patterns**: stores processed data on migration patterns, including start and end dates, routes, and population sizes.
* **Animal_Behavior**: stores information about animal behavior, such as feeding habits, mating rituals, and habitat preferences.
* **Conservation_Status**: stores information about conservation efforts, including habitat protection, species reintroduction, and research grants.

The following table illustrates the relationships between tables:
```
Sensor_Data
  |
  |  -- Migration_Patterns (one-to-many)
  |
  |  -- Animal_Behavior (many-to-one)
  |
  |  -- Conservation_Status (many-to-one)

Migration_Patterns
  |
  |  -- Sensor_Data (many-to-one)
```
## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints:

* **GET /migrations**: retrieves a list of migration patterns for a given time period and location.
* **GET /animalbehavior**: retrieves information about animal behavior, including feeding habits and mating rituals.
* **POST /conservationstatus**: updates conservation efforts, including habitat protection and species reintroduction.

### OpenAPI Specification

The following is an example OpenAPI spec for the APIs:
```json
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Wildlife Migration Tracker API
  description: Provides real-time data on wildlife migrations and behavior.
paths:
  /migrations:
    get:
      summary: Retrieves a list of migration patterns.
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of migration patterns.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/MigrationPattern'
  /animalbehavior:
    get:
      summary: Retrieves information about animal behavior.
      responses:
        200:
          description: Information about animal behavior.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:

                    type: string
                  matingRituals:
                    type: string
  /conservationstatus:
    post:
      summary: Updates conservation efforts.
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                habitatProtection:
                  type: boolean
                speciesReintroduction:
                  type: boolean
```
## System Flow

The system flow will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: sensors and cameras collect real-time data on wildlife movements and behavior.
2. **Data Processing**: the data processing engine analyzes and filters the raw sensor data to extract meaningful insights about wildlife migrations.
3. **Data Storage**: processed data is stored in the database.
4. **Visualization**: the visualization platform provides interactive maps and dashboards that display migration patterns and animal behavior.
5. **Alerts and Notifications**: alerts and notifications are sent to conservationists, researchers, and stakeholders about significant events or changes in wildlife populations.

The following diagram illustrates the system flow:
```
