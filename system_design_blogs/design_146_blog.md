**Design a Virtual Reality Museum Exhibit**

**Introduction**
In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Virtual Reality Museum Exhibit". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

**Requirements**
### Functional Requirements
The core functionalities the system must provide include:

* User authentication and authorization
* Access to a virtual reality (VR) museum exhibit
* Interactive features for users to engage with the exhibit
* Integration with a museum's collection management system

Specific use cases or scenarios involve:

* A visitor arriving at the museum and accessing the VR exhibit on their personal device
* A student researching an exhibit in preparation for a school project
* A curator updating the virtual exhibit with new artifacts and information

### Non-Functional Requirements
In addition to functional requirements, we must consider performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes. For example:

* The system should be able to handle 100 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
* The system should maintain a minimum uptime of 99.9% over the course of a year.

**High-Level Architecture**
The system will consist of several key components, including:

* A frontend application for user interaction
* A backend API for processing requests and managing data
* A database for storing exhibit information and visitor interactions
* Integration with the museum's collection management system

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Frontend App  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |   Backend API    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Database)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database Schema  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Collection Management System)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | Museum Collection  |
          +---------------+
```
**Database Schema**
The database schema will include the following tables and relationships:

* `Exhibits`: stores information about each exhibit, including title, description, and artifacts
* `Artifacts`: stores information about individual artifacts, including name, description, and image URLs
* `Visitors`: stores user authentication and authorization data
* `Interactions`: stores visitor interactions with the exhibit, including timestamps and comments

Indexing strategies will be used to improve query performance.

**API Design**
### Key Endpoints**

1. **GET /exhibits**: returns a list of all exhibits
2. **GET /exhibits/{id}**: returns information about a specific exhibit
3. **POST /interactions**: creates a new interaction record for a visitor

Example requests and responses:

* `GET /exhibits`: `[{"id": 1, "title": "Ancient Egypt"}, {"id": 2, "title": "Greek Gods"}]`
* `GET /exhibits/1`: `{"id": 1, "title": "Ancient Egypt", "description": "..."}`

### OpenAPI Specification**
The following is an example OpenAPI specification for the API:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Virtual Reality Museum Exhibit API
  description: API for accessing and interacting with virtual reality museum exhibits
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /exhibits:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of all exhibits
      responses:
        200:
          description: List of exhibits
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Exhibit'

  /exhibits/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Returns information about a specific exhibit
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: id
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        200:
          description: Exhibit information
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Exhibit'

  /interactions:
    post:
      summary: Creates a new interaction record for a visitor
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                exhibit_id:
                  type: integer
                timestamp:
                  type: string
                comment:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: New interaction created
```
**System Flow**
The system flow involves the following interactions:

1. A user accesses the VR museum exhibit on their device.
2. The frontend app sends a request to the backend API to retrieve exhibit information.
3. The backend API queries the database and returns the requested data.
4. The frontend app displays the exhibit information to the user.
5. The user interacts with the exhibit (e.g., views artifacts, leaves comments).
6. The frontend app sends an interaction record to the backend API for storage.

**Challenges and Solutions**
Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Scalability: how will we handle increased load and maintain performance?
* Security: how will we protect user data and prevent unauthorized access?

Solutions or trade-offs for each challenge include:

* Load balancing and autoscaling to ensure scalability
* Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure security

**Scalability and Performance**
To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance, we will implement:

* Load balancing: distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers
* Autoscaling: automatically scale up or down based on demand
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval

**Security Considerations**
To protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, we will implement:

* Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms using industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth)
* Encryption: secure data transmission between the frontend app and backend API using TLS
* Access controls: restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles and permissions

**ASCII Diagrams**
The following is an ASCII diagram illustrating the system flow:

          |  Frontend App  |
