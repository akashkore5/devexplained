**Design a Real-time Wildlife Habitat Monitoring System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for real-time wildlife habitat monitoring. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide include:

* Real-time data collection from sensors deployed in the wildlife habitats
* Processing and analysis of sensor data to detect anomalies and alert wildlife conservationists
* Integration with existing databases for storing habitat information and sensor readings
* User-friendly interface for viewing real-time data and receiving alerts

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Monitoring temperature, humidity, and light levels in a forest habitat to detect early signs of climate change
* Tracking the movement patterns of endangered species using GPS tracking devices
* Detecting invasive species or poachers in protected areas

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, such as:

* Performance: The system should be able to process data from multiple sensors in real-time without experiencing significant delays.
* Scalability: As the number of sensors and habitats increases, the system should be able to handle increased load without compromising performance.
* Reliability: The system should ensure that critical data is not lost or corrupted, even in case of hardware failure.

## High-Level Architecture

The system architecture can be broken down into the following components:

1. **Sensor Network**: A network of sensors deployed in wildlife habitats to collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, light levels, and movement patterns.
2. **Data Processing**: A server or cluster of servers responsible for processing and analyzing sensor data to detect anomalies and alert conservationists.
3. **Database**: A database system for storing habitat information, sensor readings, and alerts.
4. **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface for viewing real-time data and receiving alerts.

## Database Schema

The database schema can be designed as follows:

**Habitats Table**

* `id` (primary key)
* `name`
* `location`
* `description`

**Sensors Table**

* `id` (primary key)
* `habitat_id` (foreign key referencing the Habitats table)
* `type` (temperature, humidity, light level, etc.)
* `reading_frequency`

**Sensor Readings Table**

* `id` (primary key)
* `sensor_id` (foreign key referencing the Sensors table)
* `timestamp`
* `value`

**Alerts Table**

* `id` (primary key)
* `sensor_id` (foreign key referencing the Sensors table)
* `threshold_value`
* `alert_timestamp`

Indexing strategies:

* Index the Habitats table on the `name` column
* Index the Sensors table on the `habitat_id` and `type` columns

## API Design

### Key Endpoints

1. **Get Habitat Readings**: Retrieve real-time sensor readings for a specific habitat.
	* Request: `GET /habitats/{habitat_id}/readings`
	* Response:
```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": 1643723400,
    "value": 25.5,
    "sensor_type": "temperature"
  },
  {
    "timestamp": 1643723450,
    "value": 70.2,
    "sensor_type": "humidity"
  }
]
```
2. **Create Alert**: Trigger an alert for a specific sensor reading.
	* Request: `POST /alerts`
	* Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "sensor_id": 12,
  "threshold_value": 25.5,
  "alert_timestamp": 1643723400
}
```

                alert_timestamp:
                  type: integer
```

## System Flow

The system flow can be described as follows:

1. Sensor data is collected from the sensor network and transmitted to the Data Processing component.
2. The Data Processing component processes and analyzes the sensor data to detect anomalies.
3. If an anomaly is detected, an alert is triggered and stored in the Alerts table.
4. Conservationists can view real-time data and receive alerts through the Web Interface.

## Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing this system include:

* Scalability: As the number of sensors and habitats increases, the system must be able to handle increased load without compromising performance.
	+ Solution: Use a distributed architecture with multiple nodes for processing and storage.
* Security: Protecting sensitive data and ensuring only authorized personnel can access the system.
	+ Solution: Implement secure protocols for transmitting sensor data and authenticating users.

## Scalability and Performance

Strategies to ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance include:

* Load balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple nodes to prevent overload.
* Caching: Store frequently accessed data in memory or cache layers to reduce database queries.
* Horizontal scaling: Add more nodes to the system as needed to increase processing power.
