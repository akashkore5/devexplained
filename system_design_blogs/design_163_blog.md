**Design a Real-time Epidemic Contact Tracing System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a real-time epidemic contact tracing system. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide include:

* Real-time tracking of contacts between individuals
* Identification of potential infection zones
* Notification of high-risk contacts
* Data analytics for epidemiological insights

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A user reports symptoms and the system identifies their recent interactions
* The system detects a cluster of cases in a specific area and notifies relevant authorities
* A healthcare professional receives real-time updates on potential exposure risks

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, including:

* Performance: respond to requests within 500ms
* Scalability: handle up to 100,000 users simultaneously
* Reliability: ensure 99.9% uptime
* Security: protect user data and prevent unauthorized access

## High-Level Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

* **Mobile App**: users install an app that tracks their interactions and reports symptoms
* **Contact Tracing Server**: processes contact data, identifies potential infection zones, and notifies high-risk contacts
* **Database**: stores user data, interaction records, and epidemiological insights
* **API Gateway**: handles API requests and routes them to the Contact Tracing Server or Database
* **Analytics Engine**: provides real-time analytics for epidemiological insights

The following diagram illustrates the architecture:
```

          |  Mobile App  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | API Gateway   |
          +---------------+

          |  Database    |
          +---------------+

          +---------------+
          | Analytics Engine|
          +---------------+
```
## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

* **users**: user information (e.g., name, contact info)
* **interactions**: records of user interactions (e.g., location, timestamp)
* **symptoms**: reported symptoms and their corresponding dates
* **exposure_risks**: calculated exposure risks for each interaction
* **epidemiological_insights**: aggregated analytics for epidemiological insights

The following SQL script creates the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE interactions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE symptoms (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    symptom VARCHAR(255),
    date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE exposure_risks (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    interaction_id INT,
    risk_level DECIMAL(3,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (interaction_id) REFERENCES interactions(id)
);

CREATE TABLE epidemiological_insights (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    cases INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (date) REFERENCES symptoms(date)
);
```
## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The system provides the following key endpoints:

* **POST /users**: creates a new user account
* **GET /interactions**: retrieves a list of interactions for a given user
* **POST /symptoms**: reports a symptom and its corresponding date
* **GET /exposure_risks**: retrieves a list of exposure risks for a given interaction

### OpenAPI Specification

The following OpenAPI spec defines the APIs:

## System Flow

The system flow consists of the following steps:

1. User installs and configures the mobile app
2. App tracks interactions and reports symptoms to the Contact Tracing Server
3. Server processes contact data, identifies potential infection zones, and notifies high-risk contacts
4. Database stores user data, interaction records, and epidemiological insights
5. Analytics Engine provides real-time analytics for epidemiological insights

## Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Handling large volumes of data and ensuring scalability
* Maintaining user privacy and security while providing real-time analytics
* Ensuring accurate and timely reporting of symptoms and exposure risks

Solutions to these challenges include:

* Utilizing cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and reliability
* Implementing robust data encryption and access controls for user privacy and security
* Developing a reliable and efficient symptom reporting mechanism

## Conclusion

The Epidemic Contact Tracing System is a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing interactions, identifying potential infection zones, and notifying high-risk contacts. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, robust data encryption, and efficient analytics engines, we can ensure the scalability, reliability, and security of this system while providing real-time insights for epidemiological research and public health decision-making.
