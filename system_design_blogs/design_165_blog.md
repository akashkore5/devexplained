**Design a Smart Renewable Energy Forecasting System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Smart Renewable Energy Forecasting". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide are:

* Predictive energy generation forecasting based on historical data and real-time weather conditions
* Integration with existing renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro)
* Real-time monitoring and analysis of energy production and consumption
* Visualization of energy usage patterns and forecasts for users

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system should have the following quality attributes:

* Performance: respond to requests within 500ms
* Scalability: handle a load of up to 10,000 concurrent users
* Reliability: ensure data integrity and availability with a downtime of less than 1 hour per month
* Security: protect user data and prevent unauthorized access

## High-Level Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

* **Data Ingestion Layer**: responsible for collecting and processing historical weather data, energy production data, and real-time sensor readings
* **Forecasting Engine**: uses machine learning algorithms to predict energy generation based on historical data and real-time conditions
* **Database**: stores historical data, forecasted results, and system metadata
* **API Gateway**: handles API requests and provides a unified interface for clients
* **Visualization Layer**: presents energy usage patterns and forecasts to users

## System Flow

The system flow involves the following steps:

1. Data ingestion layer collects and processes historical weather data, energy production data, and real-time sensor readings.
2. Forecasting engine uses machine learning algorithms to predict energy generation based on historical data and real-time conditions.
3. Predicted results are stored in the database for future reference.
4. API gateway handles API requests and provides a unified interface for clients.
5. Visualization layer presents energy usage patterns and forecasts to users.
