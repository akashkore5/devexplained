**Design a Smart Urban Waste Recycling System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Smart Urban Waste Recycling". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The system must provide the following core functionalities:

* Residents can report waste issues through a mobile app or web portal
* Waste collection vehicles are dispatched to collect reported waste
* The system tracks waste collections and generates reports on waste diversion rates
* Waste management facilities receive notifications for collections and process waste accordingly

Specific use cases include:

* A resident reporting a missed garbage collection
* A waste management facility receiving a notification for an upcoming collection
* A city official reviewing waste diversion rates to inform policy decisions

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also consider the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: The system should respond quickly to requests and minimize latency
* Scalability: The system should be able to handle increased load and maintain performance as the number of users grows
* Reliability: The system should be designed for high availability and minimal downtime
* Security: The system must protect sensitive data, such as resident information and waste collection routes

### High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

* **Web Portal**: A public-facing interface for residents to report waste issues and view waste diversion rates
* **Mobile App**: A mobile application for residents to report waste issues on-the-go
* **Waste Collection Management System**: A system for managing waste collection routes, schedules, and notifications
* **Data Analytics**: A component for processing and analyzing waste collection data
* **API Gateway**: A gateway for API requests from the web portal, mobile app, and waste management facilities

The architecture is depicted in the following ASCII diagram:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Web Portal  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (REST API)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Mobile App   |       |  Waste Collection  |
|               |       |  Management System |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  | (MQTT or WebSocket)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Data Analytics |       |  API Gateway    |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```
### Database Schema

The system will use a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store data. The following tables and relationships will be used:

* **Residents**: stores resident information, including contact details and waste collection preferences
* **Waste Collections**: stores waste collection routes, schedules, and notifications
* **Waste Diversion Rates**: stores waste diversion rates for each waste stream (e.g., recycling, composting)
* **Notifications**: stores notifications sent to residents and waste management facilities

Indexing strategies will be used to improve query performance.

### API Design

The system will provide the following key endpoints:

* **POST /waste-issues**: reports a waste issue from a resident
* **GET /waste-diversion-rates**: retrieves waste diversion rates for a specific waste stream
* **PUT /waste-collections**: updates waste collection routes and schedules

Example requests and responses are as follows:
```json
// POST /waste-issues
{
  "resident_id": 123,
  "issue_type": "missed_collection",
  "description": "My garbage was not collected on Friday"
}

// GET /waste-diversion-rates
[
  {
    "waste_stream": "recycling",
    "diversion_rate": 0.8
  },
  {
    "waste_stream": "composting",
    "diversion_rate": 0.9
  }
]
```
### System Flow

The system flow will be as follows:

1. A resident reports a waste issue through the web portal or mobile app.
2. The API gateway receives the request and processes it accordingly.
3. The waste collection management system updates waste collection routes and schedules based on the reported issue.
4. The data analytics component processes waste collection data to generate waste diversion rates.
5. Waste management facilities receive notifications for collections and process waste accordingly.

### Challenges and Solutions

Challenges include:

* Scalability: handling increased load and maintaining performance as the number of users grows
* Security: protecting sensitive data, such as resident information and waste collection routes

Solutions include:

* Using a scalable infrastructure, such as cloud computing or containerization
* Implementing robust security measures, including encryption and access controls

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure scalability and performance, the system will use the following strategies:

* Load balancing: distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and availability
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory to reduce query latency
* Queue-based architecture: use message queues to handle high volumes of requests and improve throughput

### Security Considerations

To ensure security, the system will implement the following measures:

* Encryption: encrypt sensitive data, such as resident information and waste collection routes
* Access controls: restrict access to sensitive areas of the system through authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Network segmentation: isolate different components of the system to prevent lateral movement in case of a breach

### ASCII Diagrams

The architecture is depicted in the following ASCII diagram:

          +---------------+
          |  Web Portal  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (REST API)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Mobile App   |       |  Waste Collection  |
|               |       |  Management System |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  | (MQTT or WebSocket)

+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Data Analytics |       |  API Gateway    |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```
### Sample SQL Schema

The following SQL script creates the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Residents (
  resident_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE WasteCollections (
  collection_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  route_id INT,
  schedule_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (route_id) REFERENCES Routes(route_id)
);

CREATE TABLE WasteDiversionRates (
  diversion_rate_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  waste_stream VARCHAR(255),
  rate DECIMAL(3,2)
);
```
### Conclusion
