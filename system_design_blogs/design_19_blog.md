**Design an Email Service**

**SEO Keywords:** email, service, system design

### Introduction

As the world becomes increasingly digital, email services have become a crucial component of our daily lives. From sending reminders to sharing important documents, emails play a vital role in communication. In this post, we'll design an email service that provides a scalable and reliable platform for sending, receiving, and managing emails.

### Problem Statement

The problem we're trying to solve is designing an email service that can handle a large volume of emails, ensuring timely delivery, and providing robust security features to prevent spam and unauthorized access. The email service should be flexible enough to accommodate various use cases, such as personal accounts, businesses, and organizations.

### High-Level Design (HLD)

#### Overview

Our email service will consist of multiple microservices working together to provide a seamless user experience. We'll use a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

#### Microservices

* **Email Sending Service**: responsible for sending emails from the sender's mailbox to the recipient's mailbox.
* **Email Receiving Service**: handles incoming emails and updates the recipient's mailbox.
* **Email Storage Service**: stores emails in a durable storage system for retrieval and archiving.
* **Authentication Service**: verifies user credentials and ensures secure access to email accounts.

#### API Gateway

We'll use AWS API Gateway as our API gateway, which will act as an entry point for all incoming requests. The API Gateway will handle API key management, rate limiting, and caching.

#### Load Balancing

We'll implement a Round-Robin load balancing strategy using HAProxy or NGINX to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.

#### Caching

To reduce the load on our Email Sending Service, we'll use Redis as an in-memory data store to cache frequently accessed email metadata.

#### Rate Limiting

We'll implement a token bucket rate limiting approach to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. The token bucket will be implemented using Redis or Memcached.

#### Database Selection

We'll use PostgreSQL as our primary database for storing email metadata, user information, and other relevant data. MongoDB will be used for storing emails themselves due to its efficient storage and retrieval capabilities.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

#### Detailed Design of Key Microservices

* **Email Sending Service**: will have the following API endpoints:
	+ `POST /send`: sends an email from a sender's mailbox to a recipient's mailbox.
	+ `GET /sent`: retrieves a list of sent emails for a given user.
* **Email Receiving Service**: will have the following API endpoints:
	+ `POST /receive`: receives an incoming email and updates the recipient's mailbox.
	+ `GET /inbox`: retrieves a list of unread emails in a recipient's inbox.

#### Database Schema (SQL)
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE emails (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    from_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    to_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### System Flow

Here's a step-by-step overview of the system flow:

1. The user sends an email using our API.
2. The Email Sending Service receives the request and validates the sender's credentials.
3. The service uses Redis to cache frequently accessed email metadata.
4. The service stores the email in PostgreSQL for later retrieval.
5. The Email Receiving Service receives incoming emails and updates the recipient's mailbox.
6. The system uses HAProxy or NGINX to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.

### Scalability and Performance

Our email service will scale horizontally by adding more instances of each microservice as needed. We'll also use sharding to partition large datasets and improve query performance.

To optimize performance, we'll:

* Use indexing on PostgreSQL for efficient querying.
* Implement query optimization techniques, such as caching and memoization.

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

We'll implement strategies to handle failures and ensure data consistency:

* Circuit breakers will prevent cascading failures by detecting and isolating failing services.
* Retries will be implemented to handle temporary failures.
* We'll use eventual consistency for most use cases, but maintain strong consistency for critical transactions.

### Conclusion

In this post, we've designed a scalable and reliable email service that provides a seamless user experience. Our system combines multiple microservices working together to ensure timely delivery, robust security features, and efficient performance. By implementing caching, load balancing, rate limiting, and database selection strategically, we can provide a reliable platform for sending, receiving, and managing emails.

**Summary**

Our email service design provides a scalable and reliable platform for sending, receiving, and managing emails. We've implemented multiple microservices working together to ensure timely delivery, robust security features, and efficient performance. Our system is designed to scale horizontally, use sharding for partitioning large datasets, and optimize query performance using indexing and query optimization techniques.
