**Design a URL Preview Service**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for designing a URL preview service. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide include:

* Extracting metadata (title, description, images) from URLs
* Generating a visual preview of the webpage content
* Returning the preview in a standardized format (JSON or XML)

Specific use cases or scenarios may involve:

* Handling different types of URLs (HTTPS, HTTP, relative, absolute)
* Supporting various content formats (text, images, videos)
* Caching previews to improve performance and reduce latency

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system should have the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a high volume of requests without significant degradation in response time.
* Scalability: The system should be designed to scale horizontally (add more nodes) or vertically (increase node resources) as needed.
* Reliability: The system should have a high uptime and be resistant to failures.
* Security: The system should protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

### High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture for the URL preview service can be broken down into three main components:

1. **URL Processor**: Responsible for extracting metadata from URLs and generating previews.
2. **Preview Generator**: Takes the extracted metadata and generates a visual representation of the webpage content.
3. **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate component, and returns the preview in a standardized format.

### Database Schema

The database schema can be designed as follows:

* **urls** table: stores URLs with corresponding metadata (title, description, images)
* **previews** table: stores generated previews with corresponding URL IDs
* **metadata_cache** table: caches extracted metadata to improve performance and reduce latency

Indexing strategies can include:

* Primary key on the **urls** table for efficient lookups
* Index on the **previews** table by URL ID for fast retrieval of related previews

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

The system will have the following main API endpoints:

* `GET /preview`: Retrieves a preview for a given URL
* `POST /preview`: Submits a URL to generate a new preview
* `GET /metadata`: Retrieves metadata (title, description) for a given URL

Example requests and responses can be:
```json
GET /preview?url=https://example.com
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "title": "Example Website",
  "description": "This is an example website.",
  "images": ["image1.jpg", "image2.png"]
}

POST /preview?url=https://new.example.com
{
  "title": "New Example Website",
  "description": "This is a new example website.",
  "images": ["new_image1.jpg", "new_image2.png"]
}
```

### OpenAPI Specification

### System Flow

The system flow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **URL Processing**: The URL Processor extracts metadata from URLs and generates previews.
2. **Preview Generation**: The Preview Generator takes the extracted metadata and generates a visual representation of the webpage content.
3. **API Request Handling**: The API Gateway handles incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate component, and returns the preview in a standardized format.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Handling different types of URLs (HTTPS, HTTP, relative, absolute)
	+ Solution: Implement URL parsing and normalization techniques.
* Supporting various content formats (text, images, videos)
	+ Solution: Use libraries or frameworks that support multiple content formats.
* Caching previews to improve performance and reduce latency
	+ Solution: Implement caching mechanisms using Redis or Memcached.

### Scalability and Performance

Strategies to ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance include:

* Horizontal scaling: Add more nodes to increase capacity.
* Vertical scaling: Increase the power of individual nodes to improve performance.
* Caching: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
* Load balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple nodes.
