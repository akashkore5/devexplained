**Design a Media Upload Service**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Media Upload Service". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The media upload service must provide the following core functionalities:

* User authentication and authorization
* File uploading (video, audio, image, and other file types)
* File validation (e.g., checking for viruses, ensuring correct format)
* File organization (storing files in a structured manner)
* Search and retrieval of uploaded files

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Users can upload multiple files at once
* Files are stored in a cloud-based storage service
* The system provides analytics on file uploads and downloads

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The media upload service must also meet the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: handle a high volume of concurrent requests without significant latency
* Scalability: be able to handle increased load and maintain performance as the number of users grows
* Reliability: minimize downtime and ensure the system remains available even in case of hardware failures or software issues

### High-Level Architecture

The media upload service will consist of the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: A web-based interface for users to interact with the system, including uploading files, viewing uploaded files, and searching for specific files.
2. **API Gateway**: A single entry point for all API requests, handling authentication, routing, and rate limiting.
3. **File Processing Service**: Responsible for processing uploaded files, including validation, organization, and storage.
4. **Database**: Stores metadata about uploaded files, including file information, user associations, and analytics data.
5. **Cloud Storage**: A cloud-based storage service for storing the actual media files.

### Database Schema

The database schema will consist of the following tables:

1. **files**: stores metadata about each uploaded file (id, name, type, size, etc.)
2. **users**: stores information about registered users (id, username, password, etc.)
3. **file_uploads**: tracks user uploads and associations with files
4. **analytics**: stores statistics on file uploads and downloads

### API Design

The media upload service will expose the following key endpoints:

* `POST /upload`: allows users to upload files
* `GET /files`: returns a list of uploaded files
* `GET /file/{id}`: returns metadata about a specific uploaded file

Example requests and responses:

```
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
{
  "filename": "example.mp4",
  "mimetype": "video/mp4"
}

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "file_id": "12345",
  "filename": "example.mp4",
  "mimetype": "video/mp4"
}
```

### System Flow

The system flow will follow the following sequence:

1. User initiates an upload request through the frontend.
2. The API gateway authenticates and validates the request.
3. The file processing service receives the uploaded file, validates its integrity, and stores it in the cloud storage.
4. The database is updated with metadata about the uploaded file.
5. Analytics data is collected and stored.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges include:

* Handling large volumes of concurrent uploads
* Ensuring secure file transfers and storing sensitive data
* Maintaining performance and scalability as the system grows

Solutions:

* Implement load balancing and autoscaling for the API gateway and file processing service.
* Use encryption and secure protocols for file transfers and storage.
* Monitor system performance and adjust configurations as needed.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance, we will:

* Use a cloud-based infrastructure with auto-scaling capabilities.
* Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the system.
* Optimize database queries and indexing strategies for improved query performance.

### Security Considerations

To protect the system and its data, we will:

* Implement secure protocols for file transfers and storage (e.g., HTTPS, encryption).
* Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
* Monitor system logs and audit trails for suspicious activity.

### ASCII Diagrams

Simple ASCII diagrams can be used to illustrate the architecture or workflows:
```
    +---------------+
    |  Frontend   |
    +---------------+
            |
            v
    +---------------+
    |  API Gateway  |
    +---------------+
            |
            v

            v
    +---------------+
    | Cloud Storage|
    +---------------+
```

### Sample SQL Schema

SQL scripts for creating the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE file_uploads (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  file_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES files(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Example JSON API Response

Example JSON responses for key API endpoints:
```json
GET /files
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "example.mp4",
      "type": "video/mp4"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "another_file.txt",
      "type": "text/plain"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Summary

The design of the media upload service involves understanding the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system. The system will consist of key components including a frontend, API gateway, file processing service, database, and cloud storage. To ensure scalability and performance, we will implement load balancing and autoscaling, caching mechanisms, and optimize database queries. To protect sensitive data, we will use secure protocols for file transfers and storage, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and monitor system logs and audit trails.
