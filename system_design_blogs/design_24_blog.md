**Design a URL Shortener**

**Introduction**
In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a URL Shortener". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

**Requirements**

### Functional Requirements
The core functionalities the system must provide are:

* Creating a short URL from a given long URL
* Retaining the original URL's metadata (e.g., title, description)
* Handling redirects from the short URL to the original URL
* Tracking analytics for each shortened URL (e.g., number of views, clicks)

Use cases or scenarios include:

* A user wants to share a lengthy article link on social media, but it's too long. They can use our system to shorten the link and make it easier to share.
* An e-commerce platform needs to create short URLs for product links to improve customer experience.

### Non-Functional Requirements
The system must also consider non-functional requirements such as:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of requests per second without significant latency or downtime.
* Scalability: As the number of users and shortened URLs grows, the system should be able to scale horizontally or vertically to maintain performance.
* Reliability: The system must ensure that redirects are reliable and minimize the risk of errors or timeouts.

**High-Level Architecture**
The high-level architecture for our URL shortener system consists of:

1. **Frontend**: A web interface (e.g., React, Angular) for users to input long URLs and create shortened links.
2. **Shortener Service**: A microservice responsible for generating unique short URLs and storing the original URL metadata.
3. **Redirect Service**: Another microservice handling redirects from the short URL to the original URL.
4. **Analytics Service**: A third microservice tracking analytics data (e.g., views, clicks) for each shortened URL.

          |  Analytics   |
          | Service      |
          +---------------+
```

**Database Schema**
Our database schema consists of three tables:

1. **urls**: Stores the original URL metadata, including the shortened URL.
2. **shortened_urls**: Maps the short URLs to their corresponding original URLs.
3. **analytics**: Tracks analytics data for each shortened URL.

[Table 1: URLs]

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | Unique identifier for the original URL |
| long_url | varchar | The original URL |
| short_url | varchar | The generated shortened URL |
| metadata | json | Original URL metadata (e.g., title, description) |

[Table 2: Shortened URLs]

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | Unique identifier for the shortened URL |
| short_url | varchar | The generated shortened URL |
| original_id | int | Foreign key referencing the urls table |

[Table 3: Analytics]

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | Unique identifier for the analytics record |
| short_url | varchar | The corresponding shortened URL |
| views | int | Number of views for the shortened URL |
| clicks | int | Number of clicks for the shortened URL |

**API Design**

### Key Endpoints

* **POST /shorten**: Creates a new shortened URL from a given long URL
	+ Request Body: `{ "long_url": "https://example.com/very-long-article" }`
	+ Response: `{ "short_url": "https://example.com/short-url" }`
* **GET /shortened/{short_url}**: Redirects to the original URL for a given shortened URL
	+ Request: `GET https://example.com/short-url`
	+ Response: `301 Moved Permanently -> https://example.com/very-long-article`

### OpenAPI Specification (Optional)

  version: 1.0.0

  /shorten:

      summary: Create a new shortened URL
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:

              type: object
              properties:
                long_url:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: Shortened URL created successfully

  /shortened/{shortUrl}:
    get:
      summary: Redirect to the original URL for a given shortened URL
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: shortUrl
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        301:
          description: Redirected to the original URL
```

**System Flow**
The system flow involves the following steps:

1. A user inputs a long URL on the frontend.
2. The frontend sends an API request to the Shortener Service with the long URL.
3. The Shortener Service generates a unique shortened URL and stores the original URL metadata in the database.
4. The Redirect Service handles redirects from the short URL to the original URL, using the shortened_urls table to map the short URLs to their corresponding original URLs.
5. The Analytics Service tracks analytics data for each shortened URL.

**Challenges and Solutions**
Potential challenges and solutions include:

* **Collision Detection**: To minimize collisions between shortened URLs, we can use a combination of hashing algorithms and unique identifier generation.
* **Scalability**: We can scale the system horizontally by adding more instances of the Shortener Service or vertically by upgrading hardware.

**Scalability and Performance**
Strategies to ensure scalability and performance include:

* **Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of the frontend, Shortener Service, and Redirect Service.
* **Caching**: Caching frequently accessed data in a fast storage layer (e.g., Redis) to reduce database queries.

**Conclusion**
