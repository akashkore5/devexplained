**Design an Online Compiler**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design an Online Compiler". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The online compiler must provide the following core functionalities:

* Support for various programming languages (e.g., C, Java, Python)
* Code editing and syntax highlighting
* Compilation of user-submitted code into executable files or bytecode
* Error handling and feedback for compilation errors
* Support for uploading and managing compiled binaries

Specific use cases include:

* Students submitting assignments and receiving feedback on their code
* Developers working on projects and needing a quick way to test and iterate on their code

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also satisfy the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: fast compilation times and minimal latency
* Scalability: handle a large number of users and submissions
* Reliability: minimize downtime and ensure data integrity
* Security: protect user data and prevent malicious code execution

### High-Level Architecture

The online compiler system consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend**: Handles user input, provides code editing and syntax highlighting.
2. **Compiler Engine**: Responsible for compiling user-submitted code into executable files or bytecode.
3. **Database**: Stores compiled binaries, user data, and metadata (e.g., submission timestamps).
4. **API Gateway**: Manages incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate components.

### Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Users**:
	* `id` (primary key)
	* `username`
	* `password` (hashed)
	* `email`
2. **Submissions**:
	* `id` (primary key)
	* `user_id` (foreign key referencing the Users table)
	* `code` (text data type for storing user-submitted code)
	* `compiled_binary` (binary data type for storing compiled binaries)
3. **CompilationResults**:
	* `id` (primary key)
	* `submission_id` (foreign key referencing the Submissions table)
	* `status` (e.g., success, failure, error message)

Indexing strategies:

1. Create an index on the `user_id` column in the `Submissions` table for fast lookup of user submissions.
2. Create an index on the `submission_id` column in the `CompilationResults` table for efficient retrieval of compilation results.

### API Design

The online compiler system provides the following key endpoints:

1. **POST /submit**: Submits code to the compiler engine and returns a unique submission ID.
	* Request Body: Code text
	* Response: Submission ID (e.g., "1234567890")
2. **GET /compile/:submission_id**: Retrieves the compilation result for a given submission ID.
	* Path Parameter: Submission ID (e.g., "1234567890")
	* Response: Compilation status and error message (if any)

                    type: integer

          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:

            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: string
                  errorMessage:
                    type: string
```

### System Flow

The system flow involves the following steps:

1. User submits code through the frontend.
2. The API gateway routes the request to the compiler engine.
3. The compiler engine compiles the user-submitted code and generates a compiled binary.
4. The compiled binary is stored in the database, along with metadata (e.g., submission timestamp).
5. When a user requests their compilation result, the API gateway retrieves the relevant data from the database and returns it to the user.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges:

* **Security**: Protecting user data and preventing malicious code execution.
	+ Solution: Implement secure coding practices, use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS), and conduct regular security audits.
* **Scalability**: Handling increased load and maintaining performance.
	+ Solution: Design for scalability from the outset, using technologies like cloud computing or load balancers.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure scalability and performance, consider:

1. **Cloud Computing**: Leverage cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalable infrastructure and reduced maintenance burdens.
2. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce the load on the system and improve response times.
3. **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances or nodes.

### Security Considerations

To ensure security:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.
2. **Encryption**: Use encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) for secure data transmission.
3. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update dependencies, libraries, and software to prevent vulnerabilities.
