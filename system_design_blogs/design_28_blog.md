**Design a Survey Management System**
=============================

### **Introduction**

A survey management system is a crucial tool for organizations to collect, manage, and analyze feedback from customers, employees, or other stakeholders. In this blog post, we will design a robust and scalable survey management system that meets the needs of modern organizations.

### **Problem Statement**

The existing survey management systems are often cumbersome, inflexible, and difficult to integrate with other systems. They lack real-time analytics, scalability, and security features, making it challenging for organizations to collect and analyze feedback efficiently. Our goal is to design a system that addresses these limitations and provides a seamless experience for users.

### **High-Level Design (HLD)**

Our survey management system will be designed as a microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance.

#### Microservices Involved:

* **Survey Service**: Responsible for creating, managing, and retrieving surveys.
* **Response Service**: Handles incoming responses from users and stores them in the database.
* **Analytics Service**: Provides real-time analytics and insights on survey data.
* **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.

#### API Gateway

We will use AWS API Gateway as our API gateway, which provides features like API keys, rate limiting, and caching. The API Gateway will act as an entry point for all incoming requests and route them to the corresponding microservices.

#### Load Balancing Strategy

To ensure high availability and scalability, we will implement a load balancing strategy using Round-Robin DNS. This approach will distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of our services, ensuring that no single instance becomes overwhelmed.

#### Caching Strategy

We will use Redis as our caching layer to store frequently accessed data, such as survey metadata and response summaries. This will reduce the load on our database and improve the overall system performance.

#### Rate Limiting Approach

To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, we will implement rate limiting using a token bucket algorithm. This approach will limit the number of requests an IP address can make within a certain time frame.

#### Database Selection

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for storing survey metadata, responses, and analytics data. We will also use MongoDB for storing response summaries and other aggregated data.

Here is an ASCII diagram of our system architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  API Gateway  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Requests)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Survey Service  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Surveys)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Response Service  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Responses)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Analytics Service  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Analytics)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Authentication   |
          |  Service            |
          +---------------+
```
### **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

#### Detailed Design of Key Microservices:

* **Survey Service**: The Survey Service will have the following endpoints:
	+ `GET /surveys`: Returns a list of available surveys.
	+ `POST /surveys`: Creates a new survey with provided metadata.
	+ `GET /surveys/{id}`: Retrieves a specific survey by ID.
* **Response Service**: The Response Service will have the following endpoints:
	+ `POST /responses`: Handles incoming responses from users and stores them in the database.
	+ `GET /responses`: Returns a list of all responses.

Here is an example API endpoint in Java:
```java
public class SurveyController {
    @GetMapping("/surveys")
    public List<Survey> getSurveys() {
        // Return a list of available surveys
    }

    @PostMapping("/surveys")
    public void createSurvey(@RequestBody Survey survey) {
        // Create a new survey with provided metadata
    }
}
```
Here is an example OpenAPI specification:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Survey Management System API
  description: API for managing surveys and responses
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /surveys:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of available surveys
      responses:
        200:
          description: List of available surveys
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Survey'
    post:
      summary: Creates a new survey with provided metadata
      requestBody:
        description: Survey metadata
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Survey'
      responses:
        201:
          description: New survey created successfully

  /responses:
    post:
      summary: Handles incoming responses from users and stores them in the database
      requestBody:
        description: Response data
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Response'
      responses:
        201:
          description: Response stored successfully

components:
  schemas:
    Survey:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        title:
          type: string
        metadata:
          type: object
```
Here is an example JSON API response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Sample Survey",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "This is a sample survey"
  }
}
```
### **Scalability and Performance**

To ensure scalability, we will implement horizontal scaling by adding more instances of our services as needed. We will also use sharding to distribute data across multiple databases.

For performance optimization, we will:

* Use indexing on database columns to improve query performance.
* Optimize database queries using efficient algorithms and caching.
* Implement lazy loading for related data to reduce the number of database queries.

### **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**

To ensure reliability and fault tolerance, we will implement strategies like circuit breakers to handle failures. We will also use retries to reattempt failed requests.

For data consistency, we will use eventual consistency approach, which allows for some degree of inconsistency in exchange for improved performance and availability.

### **Conclusion**

In this blog post, we designed a robust and scalable survey management system that meets the needs of modern organizations. Our system architecture is based on microservices, with a load balancing strategy to ensure high availability and scalability. We also implemented caching and rate limiting to improve performance and prevent abuse.
