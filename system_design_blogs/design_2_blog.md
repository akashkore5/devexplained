### Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, ensuring the scalability and reliability of our systems has become increasingly crucial. One common challenge we face is managing incoming traffic to prevent overwhelming our services with excessive requests. In this post, I'll outline a system design for implementing a rate limiter, allowing us to regulate the number of requests and maintain a healthy flow of traffic.

### Problem Statement

As our applications grow in popularity, we may encounter situations where an external service or API is overwhelmed by repeated requests within a short timeframe. This can lead to errors, slow responses, or even system crashes. A rate limiter helps prevent these issues by restricting the number of requests within a specific time window.

### High-Level Design (HLD)

#### Overview

Our rate limiter system consists of several microservices:

* **Request Tracker**: responsible for tracking and storing request data.
* **Rate Limiting Service**: enforces the rate limit based on the tracked requests.
* **API Gateway**: handles incoming API calls and routes them to the appropriate service.

#### Microservices

1. **Request Tracker**:
	* Responsible for storing request metadata (e.g., IP address, timestamp).
	* Utilizes a caching layer (Redis) to store recent requests for faster lookup.
2. **Rate Limiting Service**:
	* Applies rate limits based on the tracked requests and configured rules.
	* Integrates with the API Gateway to enforce the rate limit.
3. **API Gateway**:
	* Handles incoming API calls and routes them to the appropriate service (Request Tracker or Rate Limiting Service).

#### Load Balancing

We'll employ a Round-Robin load balancing strategy to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.

#### Caching

To reduce the overhead of storing request data, we'll utilize Redis as our caching layer. This will enable faster lookup and retrieval of recent requests.

#### Rate Limiting Approach

We'll implement a token bucket rate limiting approach. This involves maintaining a token bucket for each IP address, where tokens are released at a fixed rate (e.g., 10 tokens per second). When a request is made, the system checks if the IP address has enough tokens available; if not, the request is blocked until more tokens become available.

#### Database Selection

We'll use PostgreSQL as our relational database management system for storing request data. This choice provides excellent support for querying and indexing, ensuring fast retrieval of recent requests.

### ASCII Diagrams

Here's an ASCII diagram illustrating the high-level architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  API Gateway  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
+-----------------------+
|      Request Tracker    |
|  (Redis caching)     |
+-----------------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
+-----------------------+
|   Rate Limiting Service |
|  (token bucket)      |
+-----------------------+
```

### OpenAPI Specs

Here's an example of the API specification for the Rate Limiting Service:
```yaml
swagger: "2.0"
info:
  title: Rate Limiter
  description: Enforces rate limits based on tracked requests.
paths:
  /rate-limit:
    get:
      summary: Get current rate limit status
      responses:
        200:
          description: Current rate limit status
```

### Sample SQL Schema

Here's an example of the database schema for storing request data:
```sql
CREATE TABLE requests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  ip_address VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  request_data JSONB NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_ip_address ON requests (ip_address);
```

### Example JSON API Response

Here's an example of the JSON response for a successful rate limiting check:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "remaining_tokens": 8,
  "reset_timestamp": "2023-02-20T14:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Conclusion

In this post, we designed a rate limiter system that effectively regulates incoming traffic and prevents overwhelming our services with excessive requests. By employing microservices, caching, load balancing, and rate limiting approaches, we've created a scalable and reliable system for managing request rates.
