**Design a Resume Parser**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Resume Parser". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide are:

* Resume parsing: extract relevant information from resumes, including contact information, education, work experience, skills, and certifications.
* Resume validation: ensure resumes meet specific formatting and content requirements.
* Search functionality: allow users to search for resumes based on specific criteria (e.g., job title, industry, location).

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A company receives a large number of resumes from job applicants and needs to efficiently parse and validate them.
* A recruitment agency wants to provide a user-friendly interface for clients to search and filter resumes.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also consider non-functional requirements such as:

* Performance: the system should be able to handle a high volume of requests without significant latency or downtime.
* Scalability: the system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased traffic or growth.
* Reliability: the system should have a high uptime and be resistant to failures.

### High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of three main components:

1. **Resume Parser**: responsible for parsing resumes and extracting relevant information.
2. **Resume Validator**: ensures resumes meet specific formatting and content requirements.
3. **Search Index**: stores and indexes parsed resume data for efficient searching.

The components will interact as follows:
```
                +---------------+
                |  Resume    |
                |  Parser   |
                +---------------+
                        |
                        |
                        v
                +---------------+
                |  Resume     |
                |  Validator  |
                +---------------+
                        |
                        |
                        v
                +---------------+
                |  Search     |
                |  Index      |
                +---------------+
```
### Database Schema

The system will use a relational database to store and manage resume data. The schema will include the following tables:

* **resumes**: stores parsed resume data, including contact information, education, work experience, skills, and certifications.
* **resume_data**: stores additional metadata about each resume, such as timestamp and processing status.

The relationships between tables are:
```
resumes
---------
id (PK)
contact_info
education
work_experience
skills
certifications

resume_data
---------
id (PK)
resume_id (FK to resumes.id)
timestamp
processing_status
```
Indexing strategies will include:

* Index on `resumes.id` for fast lookup of resume data.
* Index on `resume_data.timestamp` for efficient querying by timestamp.

### API Design

The system will expose a RESTful API with the following key endpoints:

* **POST /parse**: sends a resume to be parsed and returns a JSON response with parsed data.
* **GET /search**: searches resumes based on specific criteria (e.g., job title, industry, location) and returns a list of matching resumes.

Example requests and responses:
```
POST /parse
{
  "resume": "<base64-encoded-resume>"
}

Response:
{
  "parsed_data": {
    "contact_info": {...},
    "education": [...],
    "work_experience": [...],
    ...
  }
}

GET /search
{
  "query": "software engineer",
  "location": "New York"
}

Response:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "contact_info": {...},
    ...
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "contact_info": {...},
    ...
  }
]
```
### System Flow

The flow of data and control through the system is as follows:

1. A resume is sent to the **Resume Parser** for parsing.
2. The parsed data is stored in the **resumes** table.
3. The **Resume Validator** ensures the resume meets specific formatting and content requirements.
4. If valid, the resume is added to the **Search Index**.
5. Users can query the **Search Index** using the **GET /search** endpoint.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing this system include:

* Handling large volumes of resumes and processing them efficiently.
* Ensuring accurate parsing and validation of resumes.
* Providing a scalable and performant search function.

Solutions or trade-offs for each challenge include:

* Implementing a distributed architecture to handle high volumes of requests.
* Developing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for accurate parsing.
* Using indexing strategies and query optimization techniques for efficient searching.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance, we will:

* Design a scalable architecture using cloud-based services or distributed computing frameworks.
* Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the system.
* Optimize database queries and indexing strategies for efficient data retrieval.

### Security Considerations

Security measures to protect the system and its data include:

* Encryption of sensitive data (e.g., resumes).
* Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access.
* Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

          |  Search     |
          |  Index      |
          +---------------+
```

### Sample SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE resumes (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  contact_info TEXT,
  education TEXT,
  work_experience TEXT,
  skills TEXT,
  certifications TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE resume_data (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  resume_id INT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  processing_status VARCHAR(20),
  FOREIGN KEY (resume_id) REFERENCES resumes(id)
);
```

### Example JSON API Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "contact_info": {...},
    ...
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "contact_info": {...},
    ...
  }
]
```
