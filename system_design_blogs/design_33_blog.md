**Introduction**
===============

In this post, we will design a comprehensive event booking system that enables users to search and reserve events, seats, or tickets for various types of gatherings. The system should be scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain.

**Problem Statement**
=====================

The current process of booking events is often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. With the rise of digital platforms, there is a need for a modern event booking system that provides a seamless user experience, efficient management, and real-time analytics.

**High-Level Design (HLD)**
==========================

### Overview of the System Architecture

The event booking system consists of several microservices working together to provide a robust and scalable solution. The architecture includes:

* **Event Service**: manages events, including creation, updates, and deletion.
* **Seat/Ticket Service**: handles seat or ticket availability, allocation, and management.
* **User Service**: authenticates and authorizes users for event booking and management.
* **Payment Gateway**: processes payment transactions securely.

### Microservices

1. **Event Service**:
	* Responsible for creating, updating, and deleting events.
	* Manages event metadata (title, description, dates, etc.).
2. **Seat/Ticket Service**:
	* Handles seat or ticket availability, allocation, and management.
	* Manages seat or ticket metadata (section, row, column, etc.).
3. **User Service**:
	* Authenticates and authorizes users for event booking and management.
	* Manages user profiles and preferences.

### API Gateway

We will use AWS API Gateway as the entry point for our system, allowing us to manage APIs, handle authentication and authorization, and route traffic to the relevant microservices.

### Load Balancing Strategy

We will implement a Round-Robin load balancing strategy using ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.

### Caching Strategy

To improve performance and reduce database queries, we will use Redis as an in-memory data grid to cache frequently accessed event metadata and seat/ticket availability information.

### Rate Limiting Approach

We will implement a token bucket rate limiting approach using NGINX to prevent excessive requests from overwhelming the system. This ensures that users can't flood the system with repeated requests.

### Database Selection

We will use PostgreSQL as our relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing event and seat/ticket metadata, user profiles, and other relevant data. This choice provides a robust and scalable solution for storing structured data.

                  | (authenticated)

          |  Seat/Ticket    |
          |  User Service   |

                  |
                  | (business logic)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database      |
          |  (PostgreSQL)  |
          +---------------+
```

**Low-Level Design (LLD)**
========================

### Detailed Design of Key Microservices

* **Event Service**: responsible for creating, updating, and deleting events. We will use Java-style API endpoints with routes, methods, request/response formats, and OpenAPI-style API specifications.
	+ API Endpoints:
		- `GET /events`: retrieve a list of all events
		- `POST /events`: create a new event
		- `PUT /events/:id`: update an existing event
		- `DELETE /events/:id`: delete an event
* **Seat/Ticket Service**: handles seat or ticket availability, allocation, and management. We will use Java-style API endpoints with routes, methods, request/response formats, and OpenAPI-style API specifications.
	+ API Endpoints:
		- `GET /seats/tickets`: retrieve a list of available seats or tickets
		- `POST /seats/tickets`: allocate a seat or ticket for an event
		- `PUT /seats/tickets/:id`: update the status of a seat or ticket
		- `DELETE /seats/tickets/:id`: deallocate a seat or ticket

### System Flow
1. User requests to book an event.
2. API Gateway authenticates and authorizes the user.
3. Event Service retrieves the requested event details.
4. Seat/Ticket Service checks availability of seats or tickets for the event.
5. If available, allocate the seat or ticket and update the database.
6. Return a confirmation message to the user.

### Scalability and Performance
We will implement horizontal scaling by adding more instances of each microservice as needed. Additionally, we will optimize query performance by indexing relevant columns in PostgreSQL.

**Reliability and Fault Tolerance**
We will implement circuit breakers to detect and prevent cascading failures between services. In case of failure, we will retry requests after a short delay.

**Conclusion**
================

The event booking system design outlined in this post provides a scalable, reliable, and efficient solution for managing events, seats, and tickets. By using microservices, API Gateway, load balancing, caching, rate limiting, and PostgreSQL as our database, we can ensure high availability, performance, and fault tolerance. This design will enable users to easily search and reserve events, seats, or tickets, while providing real-time analytics and insights for event organizers and managers.
