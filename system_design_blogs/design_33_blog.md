**Design an Event Booking System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for event booking. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide are:

* Allow users to search for events by location, date, or category
* Enable users to book an event and receive a confirmation email
* Provide administrators with tools to manage events, including creating, updating, and deleting events

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A user searching for concerts in New York City on Saturday
* An administrator creating a new event for a comedy club
* A user trying to book a sold-out event

### Non-Functional Requirements

In addition to the functional requirements, the system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, such as:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a large volume of requests without significant latency.
* Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate increased traffic or demand.
* Reliability: The system should be designed to minimize downtime and ensure that users can access the system at all times.

## High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture for the event booking system consists of several key components:

* **Frontend**: A web-based interface for users to search, book, and manage events
* **Backend**: A RESTful API for interacting with the database and performing business logic
* **Database**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing events, users, and bookings
* **Message Queue**: A message broker for handling asynchronous tasks, such as sending confirmation emails

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:
```
                  +---------------+
                  |  Frontend   |
                  +---------------+
                             |
                             | RESTful API
                             v
                  +---------------+
                  |  Backend    |
                  +---------------+
                             |
                             | Database (RDBMS)
                             v
                  +---------------+
                  |  Database   |
                  +---------------+
                             |
                             | Message Queue
                             v
                  +---------------+
                  |  Message    |
                  |  Queue     |
                  +---------------+
```
## Database Schema

The database schema consists of several tables:

* **Events**: Stores information about each event, including title, description, date, and location.
* **Bookings**: Stores information about each booking, including user ID, event ID, and booking timestamp.
* **Users**: Stores information about each user, including username, email, and password.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the tables:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Events    |
          +---------------+
                             |
                             | one-to-many
                             v
          +---------------+
          |  Bookings  |
          +---------------+
                             |
                             | many-to-one
                             v
          +---------------+
          |  Users   |
          +---------------+
```
Indexing strategies include:

* Creating an index on the `Events.date` column to facilitate fast event retrieval
* Creating an index on the `Bookings.event_id` and `Bookings.user_id` columns to facilitate fast booking lookup

## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints for the system:

* **GET /events**: Returns a list of all events
* **GET /events/{event_id}**: Returns information about a specific event
* **POST /bookings**: Creates a new booking for an event
* **GET /users**: Returns a list of all users

Example requests and responses include:

* **GET /events**: `curl http://localhost:8080/events` returns `[{"id": 1, "title": "Concert", "date": "2023-03-15"}, {"id": 2, "title": "Comedy Night", "date": "2023-04-01"}]`
* **POST /bookings**: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"event_id": 1, "user_id": 1}' http://localhost:8080/bookings` returns `{ "id": 1, "event_id": 1, "user_id": 1, "timestamp": "2023-03-15T14:30:00Z" }`

### OpenAPI Specification

The following is an example OpenAPI specification for the API:
```
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Event Booking System API
  description: API for managing events and bookings
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /events:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of all events
      responses:
        200:
          description: List of events
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Event'
  /events/{event_id}:
    get:
      summary: Returns information about a specific event
      responses:
        200:
          description: Event information
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Event'
  /bookings:
    post:
      summary: Creates a new booking for an event
      responses:
        201:
          description: New booking created
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Booking'
```
## System Flow

The system flow can be summarized as follows:

1. A user searches for events using the frontend interface.
2. The frontend sends a request to the backend API to retrieve a list of events that match the search criteria.
3. The backend API retrieves the list of events from the database and returns it to the frontend.
4. The user selects an event and clicks the "Book" button.
5. The frontend sends a request to the backend API to create a new booking for the selected event.
6. The backend API validates the booking information and creates a new booking record in the database.
7. The system sends a confirmation email to the user using the message queue.

## Challenges and Limitations

The following are some of the challenges and limitations of the system:

* Handling concurrent bookings for the same event
* Ensuring that each user can only book one ticket per event
* Handling errors and exceptions in the booking process
* Integrating with external payment gateways for processing payments
