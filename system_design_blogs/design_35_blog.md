**Design an Online Code Judge**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for an online code judge. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide include:

* Users can submit their code to be judged
* The system can run the submitted code against a set of test cases
* The system returns the results of the code execution, including any errors or warnings
* Users can view their submission history and track their progress

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, such as:

* Performance: the system should be able to handle a large volume of submissions and requests without significant delay
* Scalability: the system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased traffic
* Reliability: the system should be designed to minimize downtime and ensure that user data is preserved in case of failures

## High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture of the system consists of the following components:

* **Frontend**: a web-based interface for users to submit their code, view submission history, and track their progress
* **Judge Service**: a service responsible for running the submitted code against a set of test cases and returning the results
* **Database**: a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store user submissions, test cases, and results

The components interact as follows:

1. A user submits their code through the frontend.
2. The judge service receives the submission and runs it against the test cases.
3. The judge service returns the results of the code execution to the frontend.
4. The frontend displays the results to the user.

          +---------------+
          |  Frontend   |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | Submit Code
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Judge Service  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | Run Code against
                  | Test Cases
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database     |
          +---------------+
```

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

* **submissions**: stores information about each submission, including user ID, code, and timestamp
* **test_cases**: stores information about each test case, including input data, expected output, and timestamp
* **results**: stores the results of each submission against each test case, including pass/fail status and any errors or warnings

The relationships between the tables are as follows:

* A submission can have multiple test cases (one-to-many).
* A test case can be associated with multiple submissions (many-to-many).
* A result is linked to a single submission and test case (many-to-one).

Indexing strategies include:

* Indexing the submissions table by user ID for fast lookup
* Indexing the test_cases table by timestamp for efficient query performance

## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The system has the following key endpoints:

* **POST /submit**: accepts a code submission and runs it against the test cases
* **GET /results**: returns the results of the most recent submission for a given user
* **GET /submission_history**: returns a list of past submissions for a given user

### OpenAPI Specification

Here is an example OpenAPI spec for the APIs:

```
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Online Code Judge API
  description: API for submitting code and viewing submission history
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /submit:
    post:
      summary: Submit a new code
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                code:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: Code submission successful
        400:
          description: Invalid request
  /results:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve the most recent submission results
      responses:
        200:
          description: Results retrieved successfully
        404:
          description: No submissions found for user
  /submission_history:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of past submissions
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: user_id
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        200:
          description: Submission history retrieved successfully
        404:
          description: No submissions found for user
```

## System Flow

The system flow can be summarized as follows:

1. A user submits their code through the frontend.
2. The judge service receives the submission and runs it against the test cases.
3. The judge service returns the results of the code execution to the frontend.
4. The frontend displays the results to the user.

          +---------------+
          |  Frontend   |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | Submit Code
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Judge Service  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | Run Code against
                  | Test Cases
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database     |
          +---------------+
```

## Challenges and Solutions

One potential challenge is handling a large volume of submissions and requests. To address this, we can implement load balancing and scalability measures, such as:

* Horizontal scaling: add more instances of the judge service to handle increased traffic
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory or cache layers to reduce database queries
* Queue-based processing: use message queues to process submissions asynchronously and decouple the frontend from the judge service

## Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance, we can implement strategies such as:

* Load balancing: distribute traffic across multiple instances of the judge service
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory or cache layers to reduce database queries
* Queue-based processing: use message queues to process submissions asynchronously and decouple the frontend from the judge service

## Security Considerations

To protect the system and its data, we can implement measures such as:

* Authentication: require users to log in with a username and password before submitting code
* Authorization: restrict access to submission results based on user roles or permissions
* Input validation: validate user input to prevent malicious code submissions
* Encryption: encrypt sensitive data, such as code submissions, using secure encryption algorithms

## Conclusion

We also highlighted potential challenges and solutions for scalability, performance, and security. This system can be used to evaluate student submissions or facilitate collaborative coding efforts.
