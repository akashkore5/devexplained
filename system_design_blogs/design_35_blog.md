**Design an Online Code Judge**

### Introduction
In this blog post, we will explore the design of a comprehensive online code judge system. The purpose of this system is to enable users to submit and test their programming skills by solving problems and challenges, allowing them to track their progress and compete with others. This system matters because it provides a platform for programmers to hone their coding abilities, learn from their mistakes, and engage in a fun and competitive environment.

### Problem Statement
The online code judge system aims to solve the problem of providing a platform for programmers to test and evaluate their programming skills. The system must handle a large volume of user submissions, accurately execute and evaluate each submission, and provide timely feedback to users.

### High-Level Design (HLD)

#### Overview of System Architecture

Our online code judge system consists of several microservices that work together seamlessly to provide the desired functionality. These microservices are:

1. **Submission Service**: Responsible for handling user submissions, validating inputs, and storing submitted code.
2. **Evaluation Service**: Executes the submitted code against a set of predefined test cases, evaluates its performance, and generates feedback.
3. **User Profile Service**: Manages user profiles, including their submission history, ratings, and other relevant information.

#### Microservices

| Microservice | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Submission Service | Handles user submissions, validates inputs, and stores submitted code. |
| Evaluation Service | Executes the submitted code against a set of predefined test cases, evaluates its performance, and generates feedback. |
| User Profile Service | Manages user profiles, including their submission history, ratings, and other relevant information. |

#### API Gateway

We will use AWS API Gateway as our API gateway, which provides robust features such as API keys, rate limiting, and security.

#### Load Balancing Strategy

To ensure high availability and scalability, we will implement a Round-Robin load balancing strategy using Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

#### Caching Strategy

We will use Redis as our caching layer to store frequently accessed data, such as user profiles and submission metadata. This will help reduce the load on our database and improve system performance.

#### Rate Limiting Approach

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, we will implement a token bucket rate limiting approach using AWS API Gateway's built-in features.

#### Database Selection

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for storing user profiles, submission data, and other relevant information. This is because PostgreSQL provides robust support for transactions, indexing, and query optimization, making it well-suited for handling high-traffic applications.

Here is an ASCII diagram of the architecture:
```
  +---------------+
  |  User    |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | Submission  |
  | Service      |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | Evaluation  |
  | Service      |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | User Profile|
  | Service     |
  +---------------+
           |
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | Redis Cache|
  +---------------+
           |
           |
           v
  +---------------+
  | PostgreSQL |
  +---------------+
```

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

#### Detailed Design of Key Microservices

We will provide detailed designs for the Submission Service, Evaluation Service, and User Profile Service.

**Submission Service**

* API Endpoints:
	+ `POST /submissions`: Handles user submissions, validates inputs, and stores submitted code.
	+ `GET /submissions/:id`: Retrieves a specific submission by ID.
* Java-style API Endpoints:
```java
@POST("/submissions")
public void submitCode(String code) {
    // Validate input and store code
}

@GetMapping("/submissions/{id}")
public Submission getSubmission(@PathVariable long id) {
    // Retrieve submission by ID
}
```
**Evaluation Service**

* API Endpoints:
	+ `POST /evaluations`: Executes the submitted code against a set of predefined test cases, evaluates its performance, and generates feedback.
	+ `GET /evaluations/:id`: Retrieves a specific evaluation result by ID.
* Java-style API Endpoints:
```java
@POST("/evaluations")
public Evaluation evaluateCode(String code) {
    // Execute code, evaluate performance, and generate feedback
}

@GetMapping("/evaluations/{id}")
public Evaluation getEvaluation(@PathVariable long id) {
    // Retrieve evaluation result by ID
}
```
**User Profile Service**

* API Endpoints:
	+ `GET /users/:id`: Retrieves a specific user profile by ID.
	+ `PUT /users/:id`: Updates a specific user profile by ID.
* Java-style API Endpoints:
```java
@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public UserProfile getUserProfile(@PathVariable long id) {
    // Retrieve user profile by ID
}

@PutMapping("/users/{id}")
public void updateUserProfile(@PathVariable long id, UserProfile update) {
    // Update user profile by ID
}
```

### Scalability and Performance

Our system is designed to scale horizontally using Amazon EC2 instances, allowing us to easily add or remove resources as needed. We will also implement performance optimizations such as indexing and query optimization in our database to ensure fast data retrieval.

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

To handle failures, we will implement circuit breakers and retries using Netflix Hystrix. This will prevent cascading failures and ensure that our system remains available even in the presence of errors. We will also use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to provide automatic failover and high availability.

**Conclusion**

In this blog post, we have explored the design of an online code judge system, including its architecture, microservices, API gateways, load balancing strategy, caching strategy, rate limiting approach, database selection, and scalability and performance considerations. We believe that this system will provide a robust and scalable platform for programmers to test and evaluate their coding skills.
