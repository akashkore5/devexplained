**Design a Movie Ticket Booking System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Movie Ticket Booking System". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The system must provide the following core functionalities:

* User registration and login
* Movie listing with details (title, genre, director, etc.)
* Ticket booking for selected movies and showtimes
* Payment processing through various payment gateways
* Order confirmation and receipt generation
* User profile management (e.g., account settings, order history)

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A user wants to book tickets for a movie that is about to start in 15 minutes.
* A user has booked tickets for a movie but needs to cancel them due to unforeseen circumstances.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a large volume of requests without significant delays or errors.
* Scalability: The system should be designed to scale horizontally and vertically as needed to accommodate increased traffic or load.
* Reliability: The system should minimize downtime and data loss, ensuring that user data is always available and secure.

### High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of the following key components:

* Frontend (Client-side): A web-based interface for users to interact with the system, built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
* Backend (Server-side): A RESTful API written in a language like Java or Python, handling requests from the frontend and interacting with the database.
* Database: A relational database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL, storing user data, movie information, and order details.

### Database Schema

The database schema will include the following tables:

* `users`: stores user information (username, email, password)
* `movies`: stores movie metadata (title, genre, director, etc.)
* `showtimes`: stores showtime information for each movie
* `orders`: stores ticket booking and payment details
* `order_items`: stores individual order items (movie titles, showtimes, quantities)

Relationships between tables include:

* A user can have multiple orders.
* An order is related to one or more movies.
* A movie can have multiple showtimes.

Indexing strategies will be used to optimize query performance.

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

The system will expose the following key endpoints:

* `GET /movies`: returns a list of available movies
* `GET /movies/{movieId}`: returns detailed information for a specific movie
* `POST /orders`: creates a new order with selected movie and showtime
* `GET /orders/{orderId}`: retrieves details about an existing order

Example requests and responses:

* `GET /movies`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Movie A",
    "genre": "Action"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Movie B",
    "genre": "Comedy"
  }
]
```
* `POST /orders`:
```json
{
  "movieId": 1,
  "showtime": "2023-03-15T19:30:00Z",
  "quantity": 2
}
```
* `GET /orders/{orderId}`:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "userId": 1,
  "movieId": 1,
  "showtime": "2023-03-15T19:30:00Z",
  "quantity": 2,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### OpenAPI Specification

The system will use the OpenAPI specification to define API endpoints and their parameters.

### System Flow

Data flows through the system as follows:

1. User requests movie information or ticket booking.
2. Frontend sends a request to the backend API.
3. Backend validates the request, retrieves required data from the database, and processes the request.
4. The system generates an order confirmation or receipt, which is stored in the database.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges:

* Handling high traffic and load during peak booking periods.
* Ensuring security and data integrity for sensitive user information.

Solutions:

* Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
* Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
* Use encryption and secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.

### Scalability and Performance

Strategies for ensuring scalability and performance include:

* Horizontal scaling: add more servers as needed to handle increased load.
* Vertical scaling: upgrade server resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) to improve performance.
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory or a caching layer.
* Optimizing database queries and indexing.

### Security Considerations

Security measures will include:

* Encryption for sensitive user data (passwords, credit card numbers).
* Secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access.
* Regular security audits and penetration testing.

### Sample SQL Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  genre VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE showtimes (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  movie_id INT,
  showtime DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  movie_id INT,
  showtime DATETIME,
  quantity INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id)
);
```

### Example JSON API Response
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "Movie A",
  "genre": "Action",
  "showtime": "2023-03-15T19:30:00Z",
  "quantity": 2,
  "status": "pending"
}
```
