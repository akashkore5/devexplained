## Introduction

In today's digital world, notifications are an essential part of our daily lives. Whether it's a text message from a friend, an email alert for a meeting, or a push notification from your favorite social media platform, receiving timely and relevant information is crucial. In this blog post, we'll design a notification system that allows users to receive personalized updates in real-time.

## Problem Statement

The problem our system aims to solve is the need for efficient and scalable notifications. Current systems often struggle with handling high volumes of requests, leading to delays or even failure. Our goal is to create a robust architecture that can handle a large number of users and notifications without compromising performance or reliability.

## High-Level Design (HLD)

### Overview

Our notification system will be built using a microservices architecture, comprising multiple services working together to provide a seamless user experience. The high-level design includes:

* **API Gateway**: This is the entry point for all incoming requests. We'll use AWS API Gateway as our API gateway.
* **Microservices**:
	+ **Notification Service**: responsible for processing and sending notifications.
	+ **User Service**: manages user data and authentication.
	+ **Topic Service**: handles topic subscriptions and updates.
* **Load Balancing**: we'll use Round-Robin load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of our microservices.
* **Caching**: Redis will be used as our caching layer to store frequently accessed data and reduce the number of database queries.
* **Rate Limiting**: we'll implement a token bucket algorithm to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

### Database Selection

We've chosen PostgreSQL as our primary database due to its reliability, scalability, and support for JSON data types. For caching, we'll use Redis, which provides fast access to frequently accessed data.

                                      +---------------+
                                      | Notification  |
                                      | Service        |

                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  User Service   |
                                      +---------------+
                                             |
                                             |  Topic Updates
                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  Topic Service  |
                                      +---------------+
                                             |
                                             |  Load Balancing
                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      | Redis (Caching)|
                                      +---------------+
```

## Low-Level Design (LLD)

### Notification Service

* **Java API Endpoints**:
	+ `/send-notification`: sends a notification to a user.
	+ `/get-notifications`: retrieves a user's notifications.

```java
// SendNotification.java
@GetMapping("/send-notification")
public void sendNotification(@RequestBody NotificationRequest request) {
    // process and send the notification
}

// GetNotifications.java
@GetMapping("/get-notifications")
public List<Notification> getNotifications(@PathVariable Long userId) {
    // retrieve the user's notifications
}
```

### System Flow

1. User sends a request to send a notification.
2. API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the Notification Service.
3. The Notification Service processes the request and sends the notification to the recipient.
4. The recipient's device receives the notification.

## Scalability and Performance

Our system will scale horizontally by adding more instances of our microservices as needed. We'll also implement performance optimizations such as indexing in PostgreSQL to improve query speed.

## Reliability and Fault Tolerance

We'll use circuit breakers to detect failed services and prevent cascading failures. Additionally, we'll implement retries for failed requests to ensure that notifications are sent successfully.

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we've designed a notification system that provides efficient, scalable, and reliable notifications. By using a microservices architecture with a robust API gateway, load balancing, caching, and rate limiting, our system is well-equipped to handle high volumes of requests and provide a seamless user experience. With a solid foundation in place, we can now focus on building the application logic and implementing additional features.
