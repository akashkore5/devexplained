## Introduction
The world of food delivery has become increasingly popular in recent years. With the rise of online ordering and meal kit services, consumers now have more options than ever before to enjoy their favorite foods from the comfort of their own homes. As a result, food delivery companies are looking for innovative ways to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

In this article, we will design a comprehensive system for a fictional food delivery company called "FreshBite." Our goal is to create a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly platform that can handle a high volume of orders and provide a seamless experience for customers and restaurants alike. Let's dive in!

## DB Schema

To design the database schema for FreshBite, we will need to consider several key tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Restaurants (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  address VARCHAR(255),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE MenuItems (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  restaurant_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurants(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  menu_item_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (menu_item_id) REFERENCES MenuItems(id)
);
```

## API Endpoints (in Java)

Here are some example API endpoints for the FreshBite system:

```java
// GET /restaurants
public List<Restaurant> getRestaurants() {
    return restaurantService.getRestaurants();
}

// POST /orders
public Order createOrder(Order order) {
    return orderService.createOrder(order);
}

// GET /orders/{orderId}
public Order getOrder(int orderId) {
    return orderService.getOrder(orderId);
}

// PUT /orders/{orderId}
public Order updateOrder(int orderId, Order order) {
    return orderService.updateOrder(orderId, order);
}

// DELETE /orders/{orderId}
public void deleteOrder(int orderId) {
    orderService.deleteOrder(orderId);
}
```

## System Flow

Here is a high-level overview of the system flow for FreshBite:

1. **Customer Places Order**: A customer places an order through the FreshBite website or mobile app.
2. **System Processes Order**: The system processes the order, including verifying the customer's information and checking availability of menu items.
3. **Order is Sent to Restaurant**: The system sends the order to the selected restaurant for preparation.
4. **Restaurant Prepares Order**: The restaurant prepares the order according to their standard procedures.
5. **Order is Picked Up or Delivered**: The order is either picked up by the customer or delivered to their doorstep.

## Summary

In this article, we designed a comprehensive system for a fictional food delivery company called FreshBite. We created a scalable database schema, defined API endpoints in Java, and outlined the system flow. By following these steps, you can design your own food delivery system that is efficient, user-friendly, and meets the needs of customers and restaurants.

## ASCII Diagrams

Here is an ASCII diagram showing the system flow:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Customer    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (1) Places order
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  FreshBite System  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (2) Processes order
                  |     - verifies customer info
                  |     - checks menu item availability
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Restaurant    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (3) Prepares order
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Customer    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (4) Picked up or delivered
```

## OpenAPI Specs

Here is an example OpenAPI spec for the FreshBite API:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: FreshBite API
  description: The FreshBite API provides access to restaurant and order information.
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /restaurants:
    get:
      summary: Get a list of restaurants
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of restaurants
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Restaurant'
```

## Sample SQL Schema

Here is an example SQL schema for the FreshBite database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Restaurants (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  address VARCHAR(255),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE MenuItems (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  restaurant_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES Restaurants(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  total DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  menu_item_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (menu_item_id) REFERENCES MenuItems(id)
);
```

## Example JSON API Response

Here is an example JSON response for the FreshBite API:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Pizza Palace",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "phone_number": "(555) 555-5555"
}
```
