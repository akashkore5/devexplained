### Engaging Introduction

In today's digital age, searching for resumes has become an essential task in many industries. From recruiters to hiring managers, the need to find the perfect candidate quickly and efficiently is crucial. In this blog post, we'll explore how to design a robust resume search engine that can scale with your needs.

### Problem Statement

The problem being solved is the ability to quickly and accurately search through a large database of resumes to find the ideal candidate for a particular job opening. This requires a system that can efficiently index and query the resumes, while also providing relevant search results to users.

### High-Level Design (HLD)

#### Overview of the System Architecture

The resume search engine will be built using a microservices architecture, consisting of several key services:

* **Resume Service**: responsible for storing and managing resumes
* **Search Service**: handles search queries and returns relevant results
* **Indexing Service**: maintains the index of resumes for fast querying
* **API Gateway**: provides a single entry point for clients to interact with the system

#### Microservices Involved

1. **Resume Service**:
	* Responsible for storing and managing resumes in a database (e.g., MongoDB)
	* Provides APIs for creating, updating, and deleting resumes
2. **Search Service**:
	* Handles search queries and returns relevant results from the indexed resumes
	* Uses a search algorithm (e.g., Lucene) to rank results based on relevance
3. **Indexing Service**:
	* Maintains the index of resumes for fast querying
	* Uses a database (e.g., Elasticsearch) to store the indexed data

#### API Gateway and Load Balancing Strategy

* **API Gateway**: provides a single entry point for clients to interact with the system (e.g., AWS API Gateway)
* **Load Balancing Strategy**: uses Round-Robin load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the Resume Service and Search Service

#### Caching Strategy

* **Caching Layer**: uses Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data, such as indexed resumes
* **Cache Invalidation**: invalidates cache entries when changes are made to the underlying data

#### Rate Limiting Approach

* **Rate Limiting**: uses a token bucket algorithm to limit the number of requests from a client within a certain time period (e.g., 100 requests per minute)

#### Database Selection

* **Database**: selects PostgreSQL as the database for storing resumes due to its support for large datasets and fast query performance
* **NoSQL Database**: considers using MongoDB or Cassandra for storing indexed data, depending on scalability requirements

|  Caching Layer (Redis)  |

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

#### Detailed Design of Key Microservices

* **Resume Service**:
	+ API Endpoints:
		- `GET /resumes`: returns a list of resumes
		- `POST /resumes`: creates a new resume
		- `PUT /resumes/:id`: updates an existing resume
		- `DELETE /resumes/:id`: deletes a resume
* **Search Service**:
	+ API Endpoints:
		- `GET /search?q={query}`: performs a search query and returns relevant results

#### Database Schema in SQL (if applicable)

```sql
CREATE TABLE resumes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  skills TEXT[]
);
```

### Scalability and Performance

* **Horizontal Scaling**: adds more instances of the Resume Service, Search Service, and Indexing Service as needed to handle increased traffic
* **Performance Optimizations**:
	+ indexing: uses a search algorithm (e.g., Lucene) to rank results based on relevance
	+ query optimization: optimizes SQL queries for fast performance

### Reliability and Fault Tolerance

* **Strategies for Handling Failures**: uses circuit breakers and retries to handle failures in the Resume Service, Search Service, and Indexing Service
* **Data Consistency**: ensures strong consistency in the database using transactions and locks

### Conclusion

In this blog post, we designed a robust resume search engine that can scale with your needs. The system is built on a microservices architecture, consisting of several key services: Resume Service, Search Service, Indexing Service, and API Gateway. We discussed the high-level design, low-level design, scalability, and reliability of the system.
