**Design a Password Manager**

**Introduction**
In this document, we will explore the design of a system for a password manager. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

**Requirements**
### Functional Requirements
The password manager must provide core functionalities, including:
* User authentication: allow users to create, manage, and store unique passwords for various applications.
* Password generation: generate strong, unique passwords for users.
* Vault management: store, retrieve, and update user-generated passwords.
* Security alerts: notify users of potential security breaches or compromised accounts.

Use cases:

* A user creates an account on a new website and wants to generate a strong password.
* A user forgets their login credentials and needs to reset their password.
* A user has multiple passwords stored in the vault and wants to update one.

### Non-Functional Requirements
The system must meet performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes:
* Performance: respond quickly to requests (less than 500ms).
* Scalability: handle a large number of users and login attempts.
* Reliability: minimize downtime and ensure high availability (99.9% uptime).

**High-Level Architecture**
The system will consist of the following key components:

* **User Interface**: A web-based interface for users to interact with the password manager.
* **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication, including password validation and storage.
* **Password Generation Service**: Generates strong, unique passwords for users.
* **Vault Service**: Manages and stores user-generated passwords.
* **Security Alert Service**: Sends security alerts to users in case of potential breaches.

**Database Schema**
The database schema will include the following tables:

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Users | User information, including username, password (hashed), and email |
| Vaults | Password vaults for individual users, including password entries and tags |
| Passwords | Generated passwords with unique identifiers and timestamps |

Relationships:
* One-to-many: a user can have multiple vaults.
* Many-to-one: each vault belongs to one user.

Indexing strategies:

* Primary key on Users table (username).
* Unique index on Passwords table (password_id).

**API Design**
### Key Endpoints
The system will expose the following API endpoints:
* **/users**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for users.
* **/vaults**: CRUD operations for password vaults.
* **/passwords**: Generate and retrieve passwords.

Example requests and responses:

* POST `/users`: { "username": "john", "email": "john@example.com" } -> 201 Created
* GET `/vaults/{user_id}`: [] -> 200 OK

### OpenAPI Specification**
The system will use OpenAPI specification version 3.0.

```
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Password Manager API
  description: API for managing passwords and vaults.
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of users.
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of users.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
  /vaults/{user_id}:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a user's vaults.
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of vaults.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Vault'
```

**System Flow**
The system flow will follow these steps:

1. User authentication using the Authentication Service.
2. User access to their vaults via the Vault Service.
3. Generation of new passwords using the Password Generation Service.
4. Storage and retrieval of password entries in the Vaults table.

**Challenges and Solutions**
Potential challenges include:

* Secure storage and transmission of sensitive user data.
* Handling a large number of login attempts and requests.
* Minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability.

Solutions:

* Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.
* Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA to prevent brute-force attacks.
* Design the system for scalability and reliability, using load balancing and redundancy where necessary.

**Scalability and Performance**
Strategies for ensuring the system can handle increased load and maintain performance include:

* Load balancing: distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.
* Caching: store frequently accessed data in memory or cache layers.
* Database optimization: optimize database queries, indexing, and schema design.

**Security Considerations**
To protect the system and its data:

* Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.
* Implement encryption for sensitive user data (e.g., password storage).
* Limit access to sensitive data using role-based access control (RBAC).

**ASCII Diagrams**
Here is a simple ASCII diagram illustrating the architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  User Interface  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Authentication
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Authentication  |       |  Password Generation  |
|  Service         |       +---------------+
+---------------+       |
                  |       |  Vault Service
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|  Vault Service   |       |  Security Alert  |
|                 |       |  Service          |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

**Sample SQL Schema**
Here is an example of how to create the database schema using SQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  password_hash VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Vaults (
  vault_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(username)
);

CREATE TABLE Passwords (
  password_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  vault_id INT NOT NULL,
  password_text VARCHAR(255),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (vault_id) REFERENCES Vaults(vault_id)
);
```

**Example JSON API Response**
Here is an example of what the JSON response might look like for a GET request to `/users`:
```json
[
  {
    "username": "john",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  {
    "username": "jane",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  }
]
```
