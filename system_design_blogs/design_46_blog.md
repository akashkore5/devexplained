**Design a Realtime Bidding System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Realtime Bidding System". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide include:

* Receiving bid requests from advertisers
* Processing bids in real-time to determine the winning bid for each ad slot
* Returning the winning bidder's information along with the ad creative
* Handling errors and exceptions during the bidding process

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Handling multiple advertisers competing for the same ad slot
* Supporting different types of ads (e.g., display, video, native)
* Ensuring fair and unbiased bidding process

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, including:

* Performance: The system should be able to process bid requests at a rate of 100 per second
* Scalability: The system should be able to handle increased load without sacrificing performance
* Reliability: The system should have high uptime and low error rates
* Security: The system must protect sensitive information such as bidder data and ad creative

### High-Level Architecture

The system's architecture can be broken down into the following components:

* **Bid Request Processor**: Responsible for receiving and processing bid requests from advertisers
* **Bidding Engine**: Determines the winning bidder for each ad slot based on the bids received
* **Ad Creative Server**: Serves the winning bidder's ad creative to the user
* **Database**: Stores bidder information, ad creative, and other relevant data

The components interact as follows:

```
          +---------------+
          |  Bid Request  |
          |  Processor    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Send bid request
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
|               |       |             |
|   Bidding     |       | Ad Creative  |
|   Engine      |       | Server      |
|               |       |             |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  | Receive winning bidder info
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Ad Creative  |
          |  Server      |
          +---------------+
```

### Database Schema

The database schema can be designed as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bidders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE ad_creatives (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  creative_url VARCHAR(255),
  advertiser_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (advertiser_id) REFERENCES bidders(id)
);

CREATE TABLE bids (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  bid_amount DECIMAL,
  bidder_id INT,
  ad_creative_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (bidder_id) REFERENCES bidders(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (ad_creative_id) REFERENCES ad_creatives(id)
);
```

### API Design

The system will expose the following key endpoints:

* `POST /bids`: Receive a new bid request from an advertiser
* `GET /winning_bid`: Return the winning bidder's information and ad creative for a given ad slot
* `GET /ad_creatives`: Retrieve a list of available ad creatives

Example requests and responses are as follows:

```json
// POST /bids
{
  "bid_amount": 100,
  "bidder_id": 1,
  "ad_slot_id": 2
}

// GET /winning_bid
{
  "winner": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "creative_url": "https://example.com/ad-creative.png"
}
```

### OpenAPI Specification

The system will use the following OpenAPI spec:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Realtime Bidding System API
  description: API for the Realtime Bidding System
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /bids:
    post:
      summary: Receive a new bid request from an advertiser
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                bid_amount:
                  type: integer
                bidder_id:
                  type: integer
                ad_slot_id:
                  type: integer
      responses:
        200:
          description: Bid request received successfully
        400:
          description: Invalid bid request

  /winning_bid:
    get:
      summary: Return the winning bidder's information and ad creative for a given ad slot
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: ad_slot_id
          required: true
          type: integer
      responses:
        200:
          description: Winning bid returned successfully
        404:
          description: Ad slot not found
```

### System Flow

The system flow can be summarized as follows:

1. The Bid Request Processor receives a new bid request from an advertiser.
2. The Bidding Engine processes the bids and determines the winning bidder for each ad slot.
3. The Ad Creative Server serves the winning bidder's ad creative to the user.
4. The system updates the database with the winning bidder's information and ad creative.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Handling high volumes of bid requests
* Ensuring fairness and unbiased bidding process
* Protecting sensitive information such as bidder data and ad creative

Solutions or trade-offs for each challenge include:

* Using a distributed architecture to handle high volumes of bid requests
* Implementing algorithms for fair and unbiased bidding
* Using encryption and secure protocols to protect sensitive information

### Scalability and Performance

Strategies to ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance include:

* Horizontal scaling: Adding more nodes or instances to handle increased traffic
* Load balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple nodes or instances
* Caching: Storing frequently accessed data in memory or cache

### Security Considerations

Security measures to protect the system and its data include:

* Encryption: Using encryption protocols to secure sensitive information
* Secure protocols: Using secure communication protocols such as HTTPS
* Access controls: Implementing access controls to restrict unauthorized access
