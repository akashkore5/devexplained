## Introduction
===============

As the world becomes increasingly digital, providing excellent customer support has become crucial for businesses to thrive. In this blog post, we'll design a support chat widget that enables customers to easily interact with your company's support team, enhancing their overall experience and reducing friction. Our goal is to create a scalable, performant, and reliable system that can handle a large volume of conversations.

## Problem Statement
-------------------

The problem we're trying to solve is the need for an efficient and personalized way to communicate between customers and support teams. Traditional methods like phone calls, email, or in-person interactions are often time-consuming and may not provide immediate resolutions. A chat widget offers a convenient and real-time solution, allowing customers to get answers quickly.

## High-Level Design (HLD)
-------------------------

### Overview of the System Architecture

The support chat widget system consists of multiple microservices that work together to handle customer conversations. These services are:

* **Chat Service**: handles incoming chat requests, routes them to available agents, and manages conversation history.
* **Agent Service**: assigns agents to chats, handles agent availability, and logs agent performance metrics.
* **Database Service**: stores customer information, chat transcripts, and agent performance data.

### Microservices

Our system uses the following microservices:

1. **Chat Service**:
	* Responsible for handling incoming chat requests from customers.
	* Routes chats to available agents based on their skill sets and availability.
2. **Agent Service**:
	* Manages agent availability and assigns them to chats.
	* Logs agent performance metrics, such as response time and resolution rate.

### API Gateway
----------------

We'll use an API Gateway (Kong) to handle incoming requests from customers and route them to the relevant microservices.

### Load Balancing Strategy
-------------------------

To ensure high availability and scalability, we'll employ a load balancing strategy using Round-Robin DNS. This approach distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of our microservices, ensuring that no single instance becomes overwhelmed.

### Caching Strategy
------------------

To improve system performance, we'll implement caching using Redis. This will store frequently accessed data, such as customer information and chat transcripts, reducing the load on our database service.

### Rate Limiting Approach
-------------------------

To prevent abuse and ensure fair use of the chat widget, we'll employ a rate limiting approach using a token bucket algorithm. This will limit the number of chat requests from individual customers within a given time frame.

### Database Selection
---------------------

We'll choose a relational database (PostgreSQL) for storing customer information, chat transcripts, and agent performance data. Our database schema will include tables for:

* **Customers**: stores customer information.
* **Chats**: stores chat transcripts and conversation history.
* **Agents**: stores agent information and performance metrics.

### Detailed Design of Key Microservices

* **Chat Service**:
	+ Handles incoming chat requests from customers.
	+ Routes chats to available agents based on their skill sets and availability.
	+ Manages conversation history for each chat.
* **Agent Service**:
	+ Assigns agents to chats based on their availability and skill sets.
	+ Logs agent performance metrics, such as response time and resolution rate.

### Database Schema (SQL)
```
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE chats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES agents(id),
    message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE agents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);
```

### API Endpoints (Java-style)

Here are some example API endpoints for our system:

* `POST /chats`: initiates a new chat with an available agent.
* `GET /chats/{chat_id}`: retrieves the conversation history for a specific chat.
* `PUT /agents/{agent_id}`: updates an agent's availability and skill set.

### System Flow with Numbered Steps or Bullet Points

Here's an example system flow for our support chat widget:

1. Customer initiates a new chat by sending a `POST /chats` request.
2. The API Gateway (Kong) receives the request and routes it to the Chat Service.
3. The Chat Service assigns an available agent to the chat based on their skill sets and availability.
4. The Agent Service logs the agent's performance metrics, such as response time and resolution rate.
5. The Chat Service returns the assigned agent's information to the customer.
6. The customer and agent engage in a conversation, exchanging messages.
7. When the conversation is completed, the Chat Service updates the chat transcript and stores it in the database.

## Scalability and Performance
---------------------------

### Horizontal Scaling

To scale our system horizontally, we can add more instances of each microservice to handle increased traffic. This will allow us to increase our system's capacity without modifying the underlying architecture.

### Caching

We can implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on our database and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

## Conclusion
----------------

In this blog post, we explored the design and implementation of a support chat widget system using microservices. We discussed the benefits of using microservices, including scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. We also walked through an example system architecture, detailed the design of key microservices, and provided API endpoints and OpenAPI specs for interacting with the system.
