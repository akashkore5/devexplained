**Design a Food Delivery System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for managing food delivery orders. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The system must provide the following core functionalities:

* Users can place orders for food delivery
* Restaurants can create menus and manage their inventory
* Drivers can view available routes and pickup/dropoff locations
* The system must be able to process payments and handle order status updates

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A user places an order for lunch at 12pm, and the system sends a notification to the driver to pick up the food from the restaurant.
* A restaurant adds a new menu item and updates their inventory levels in real-time.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, including:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a high volume of requests without significant latency or downtime.
* Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing user demand.
* Reliability: The system should be designed with redundancy and fault tolerance to minimize downtime and data loss.

### High-Level Architecture

The food delivery system consists of the following key components:

1. **User Interface**: A web-based interface for users to place orders, view order status, and manage their account information.
2. **Order Processing Engine**: Handles order processing, payment processing, and notification sending to drivers.
3. **Restaurant Management System**: Allows restaurants to create menus, manage inventory, and update menu items.
4. **Driver Dispatch System**: Manages driver routes, pickup/dropoff locations, and order assignment.

The architecture is shown in the following diagram:

```
          +---------------+
          |  User Interface  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (RESTful API)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Order Processing|       | Restaurant    |
| Engine        |       | Management   |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Message Queue)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Driver Dispatch|       | Database     |
| System         |       | Storage      |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

### Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables and relationships:

* **Orders**: Stores order information, including user ID, restaurant ID, menu item ID, and status (pending, in-transit, delivered).
* **Menus**: Stores menu items for each restaurant, including name, price, and inventory level.
* **Restaurant Inventory**: Tracks the current inventory levels for each restaurant.
* **Drivers**: Stores driver information, including availability and route assignments.

### API Design

The system exposes several key endpoints:

1. `POST /orders`: Creates a new order with user ID, restaurant ID, and menu item ID.
2. `GET /orders/{orderId}`: Retrieves the status of an existing order.
3. `PUT /drivers/{driverId}/availability`: Updates the availability of a driver.

Example JSON request/response:

```
Request:
{
  "userId": 123,
  "restaurantId": 456,
  "menuItemId": 789
}

Response:
{
  "orderId": 10101,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### System Flow

The system flow can be broken down into the following steps:

1. User places an order through the user interface.
2. The order processing engine processes the order and sends a notification to the driver dispatch system.
3. The driver dispatch system assigns the order to a available driver and updates the driver's route assignment.
4. The restaurant management system receives the order and updates their inventory levels.
5. The driver picks up the food from the restaurant and delivers it to the user.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Handling high volumes of requests during peak ordering times
	+ Solution: Use load balancing and caching to reduce latency and improve performance.
* Ensuring secure payment processing
	+ Solution: Implement SSL/TLS encryption for payment processing and use a trusted payment gateway.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance, we recommend:

* Using cloud-based infrastructure to scale horizontally and vertically.
* Implementing caching layers to reduce database queries.
* Optimizing database schema and query performance.

### Security Considerations

To protect the system and its data, we recommend:

* Implementing SSL/TLS encryption for all communication between components.
* Using secure password storage and authentication mechanisms.
* Regularly patching and updating software to prevent vulnerabilities.

### ASCII Diagrams

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  User Interface  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (RESTful API)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Order Processing|       | Restaurant    |
| Engine        |       | Management   |
+---------------+       +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Message Queue)
                  v
+---------------+       +---------------+
| Driver Dispatch|       | Database     |
| System         |       | Storage      |
+---------------+       +---------------+
```

### Sample SQL Schema

The following SQL script creates the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  orderId INT PRIMARY KEY,
  userId INT NOT NULL,
  restaurantId INT NOT NULL,
  menuItemId INT NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Menus (
  menuId INT PRIMARY KEY,
  restaurantId INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  inventoryLevel INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE RestaurantInventory (
  restaurantId INT PRIMARY KEY,
  menuItemId INT NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Drivers (
  driverId INT PRIMARY KEY,
  availability VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  routeAssignment TEXT
);
```

### Example JSON API Response

The following is an example JSON response for the `GET /orders/{orderId}` endpoint:
```json
{
  "orderId": 10101,
  "status": "delivered"
}
```
