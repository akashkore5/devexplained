## Introduction
A well-designed logging system is essential for any application to record and analyze its behavior. In this post, we will explore the design of a robust and scalable logging system.

**Summary:** By the end of this post, you'll have a solid understanding of how to design a logging system that can handle large volumes of log data while providing real-time insights into your application's performance.

## DB Schema

To design our logging system, we first need to decide on the database schema. For simplicity, let's use a relational database like MySQL. Here's an example SQL script for creating the necessary tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  level VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE categories (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```
## API Endpoints (in Java)

Our logging system will have three main endpoints:

1. **POST /logs**: This endpoint will accept log entries from clients and store them in the database.
```java
POST /logs
Request Body:
{
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Something important happened!",
    "category": "MY_CATEGORY"
}

Response:
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "id": 123,
    "timestamp": "2023-02-20T14:30:00Z",
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Something important happened!",
    "category": "MY_CATEGORY"
}
```
2. **GET /logs**: This endpoint will retrieve log entries based on various filters (e.g., timestamp, level, category).
```java
GET /logs
Query Parameters:
timestamp=2023-02-20T00:00:00Z&level=ERROR

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
[
    {
        "id": 456,
        "timestamp": "2023-02-20T01:30:00Z",
        "level": "ERROR",
        "message": "Something went wrong!",
        "category": "MY_CATEGORY"
    },
    {
        "id": 789,
        "timestamp": "2023-02-20T02:00:00Z",
        "level": "WARNING",
        "message": "Be careful!",
        "category": "MY_CATEGORY"
    }
]
```
3. **GET /categories**: This endpoint will retrieve a list of available log categories.
```java
GET /categories

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "MY_CATEGORY"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "ANOTHER_CATEGORY"
    }
]
```
## System Flow

Here's an overview of the system flow:

* **Step 1:** A client sends a log entry to our logging system using the `POST /logs` endpoint.
* **Step 2:** Our logging system validates the log entry and stores it in the database.
* **Step 3:** The client can retrieve log entries based on various filters using the `GET /logs` endpoint.
* **Step 4:** The client can also retrieve a list of available log categories using the `GET /categories` endpoint.

## ASCII Diagrams

Here's an ASCII diagram to illustrate our system architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Client    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (POST /logs)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Logging System  |
          |  (API Gateway)   |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (Store log entry)
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database      |
          +---------------+
```
## OpenAPI Specs

Here's an example of how our API endpoints can be defined using OpenAPI specs:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Logging System API
  description: API for logging system
  version: 1.0.0

paths:
  /logs:
    post:
      summary: Store a log entry
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                level:
                  type: string
                message:
                  type: string
                category:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: Log entry stored successfully

  /logs:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve log entries
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: timestamp
          schema:
            type: string
          required: false
        - in: query
          name: level
          schema:
            type: string
          required: false
      responses:
        200:
          description: Log entries retrieved successfully

  /categories:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve categories
      responses:
        200:
          description: Categories retrieved successfully
```
## Sample SQL Schema

Here's an example of the sample SQL schema used in our logging system:
```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  level VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE categories (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```
## Example JSON API Response

Here's an example of the JSON response for the `GET /logs` endpoint:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 123,
        "timestamp": "2023-02-20T14:30:00Z",
        "level": "INFO",
        "message": "Something important happened!",
        "category": "MY_CATEGORY"
    },
    {
        "id": 456,
        "timestamp": "2023-02-20T01:30:00Z",
        "level": "ERROR",
        "message": "Something went wrong!",
        "category": "MY_CATEGORY"
    }
]
```
