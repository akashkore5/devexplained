**Design a Cloud Storage Service**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Cloud Storage Service". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

* **Core Functionality**: Provide users with a cloud-based storage service that allows them to store, retrieve, and manage files.
* **Specific Use Cases**:
	+ Users can upload files of various sizes and types (e.g., images, documents, videos).
	+ Users can create folders and subfolders to organize their stored files.
	+ Users can share files with others through unique URLs or email invitations.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance**: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and requests without significant degradation in performance.
* **Scalability**: The system should be designed to scale horizontally and vertically as the user base grows.
* **Reliability**: The system should ensure high availability and minimize downtime for maintenance or unexpected failures.

### High-Level Architecture

The cloud storage service architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: A web-based interface that allows users to interact with the system, including file uploads, folder management, and sharing.
2. **Backend**: A server-side application that handles file storage, retrieval, and processing, as well as authentication and authorization.
3. **File Storage**: A scalable and redundant storage solution that can store and retrieve files efficiently.

### Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Users**:
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `username`
	+ `password` (hashed)
	+ `email`
2. **Files**:
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `name`
	+ `size`
	+ `type` (MIME type)
	+ `upload_date`
3. **Folders**:
	+ `id` (primary key)
	+ `name`
	+ `parent_folder_id` (foreign key referencing the parent folder)
4. **File_Folders**:
	+ `file_id` (foreign key referencing the file)
	+ `folder_id` (foreign key referencing the folder)

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

* **GET /files**: Retrieve a list of files for a given user.
* **POST /files**: Upload a new file to the system.
* **GET /folders**: Retrieve a list of folders for a given user.
* **POST /folders**: Create a new folder in the system.

#### OpenAPI Specification

```
swagger: "2.0"
info:
  title: Cloud Storage Service API
  description: APIs for interacting with the cloud storage service
paths:
  /files:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve a list of files for a given user
      responses:
        200:
          description: A list of file objects
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: '#/definitions/File'
  /files:
    post:
      summary: Upload a new file to the system
      consumes:
        - application/octet-stream
      responses:
        201:
          description: The uploaded file
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/File'
```

### System Flow

The system flow is as follows:

1. A user requests access to the cloud storage service.
2. The frontend authenticates the user and sends a request to the backend.
3. The backend verifies the user's credentials and checks for any relevant permissions.
4. If authorized, the backend handles the file upload or folder creation request.
5. The system stores the file or creates the folder in the database.
6. The system updates the frontend with the requested information.

### Challenges and Solutions

* **Data Consistency**: To ensure data consistency, we can use transactions to update the database and store files atomically.
* **Scalability**: We can scale the system horizontally by adding more servers behind a load balancer, or vertically by upgrading the hardware of individual servers.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure scalability and performance, we can:

* Use a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute static assets and reduce latency.
* Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the system.
* Monitor system performance and adjust capacity as needed.

### Security Considerations

* **Authentication**: Use secure authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to verify user identities.
* **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control to ensure users have appropriate permissions.
* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt stored files and transmitted data using industry-standard algorithms.

### Sample SQL Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255),
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Files (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  size INTEGER,
  type VARCHAR(50),
  upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Folders (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  parent_folder_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_folder_id) REFERENCES Folders(id)
);

CREATE TABLE File_Folders (
  file_id INTEGER,
  folder_id INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (file_id, folder_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (file_id) REFERENCES Files(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (folder_id) REFERENCES Folders(id)
);
```

### Example JSON API Response

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "example_file.txt",
      "size": 1024,
      "type": "text/plain"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "another_file.jpg",
      "size": 5120,
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

This concludes the blog post on designing a cloud storage system. I hope this provides a good starting point for those looking to build such a system.
