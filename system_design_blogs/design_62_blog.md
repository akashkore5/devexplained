**Design a Video Conferencing System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a video conferencing system. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities that the system must provide include:

* User registration and login
* Video conferencing with multiple users (up to 10 participants)
* Screen sharing and video recording
* Chat functionality for text-based communication during meetings
* Audio and video quality optimization
* Meeting scheduling and management

Some specific use cases or scenarios to consider are:

* A team of remote workers conducting a virtual meeting to discuss project progress
* A group of friends planning a social event using the system's conferencing features
* A company hosting webinars for customers or partners

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also satisfy certain non-functional requirements, such as:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle up to 100 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
* Scalability: The system should be designed to scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing user demand.
* Reliability: The system should have a high uptime percentage (e.g., 99.9%) and minimize downtime due to maintenance or errors.
* Security: The system must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of video conferencing data.

## High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture for the video conferencing system can be broken down into the following components:

* Frontend (WebRTC-enabled browser-based application)
	+ User interface for user registration, login, and meeting management
	+ Video conferencing capabilities using WebRTC
* Backend (Node.js-based API server)
	+ Handles user authentication and authorization
	+ Manages meeting scheduling and coordination
	+ Provides APIs for screen sharing, video recording, and chat functionality
* Database (relational database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL)
	+ Stores user information, meeting data, and conferencing metadata

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Frontend   |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Backend    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |
                  v
          +---------------+
          | Database      |
          +---------------+
```

## Database Schema

The database schema can be designed as follows:

* **users** table:
	+ id (primary key)
	+ username
	+ password (hashed)
	+ email
* **meetings** table:
	+ id (primary key)
	+ title
	+ description
	+ start_time
	+ end_time
	+ participants (foreign key referencing the users table)
* **conferences** table:
	+ id (primary key)
	+ meeting_id (foreign key referencing the meetings table)
	+ participants (foreign key referencing the users table)
	+ screen_sharing_enabled
	+ video_recording_enabled

Indexing strategies can include:

* Index on the users table's username column for efficient login and authentication
* Index on the meetings table's start_time and end_time columns for efficient meeting scheduling and management
* Index on the conferences table's meeting_id and participants columns for efficient conferencing metadata retrieval

## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints:

* **/users/register**: Creates a new user account
* **/users/login**: Authenticates an existing user account
* **/meetings/create**: Schedules a new meeting
* **/meetings/join**: Joins an existing meeting
* **/conferences/start**: Starts a video conference
* **/conferences/stop**: Stops a video conference

### OpenAPI Specification

The following is the OpenAPI spec for the APIs:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Video Conferencing System API
  description: Provides APIs for user registration, meeting scheduling, and conferencing metadata retrieval.
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users/register:
    post:
      summary: Creates a new user account
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              required:
                - username
                - password
                - email
              properties:
                username:
                  type: string
                password:
                  type: string
                  format: password
                email:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: User account created successfully
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: integer
                  username:
                    type: string
```

## System Flow

The system flow can be described as follows:

1. User registration and login: The user registers for an account using the `/users/register` API endpoint, and then logs in using the `/users/login` API endpoint.
2. Meeting scheduling: The user schedules a new meeting using the `/meetings/create` API endpoint, specifying the start time, end time, and participants.
3. Conferencing metadata retrieval: The system retrieves the conferencing metadata (e.g., screen sharing and video recording status) for the scheduled meeting using the `/conferences/start` API endpoint.
4. Video conferencing: The user joins the meeting using the `/meetings/join` API endpoint, and the system establishes a WebRTC connection for video conferencing.
5. Conferencing metadata updating: During the conference, the system updates the conferencing metadata (e.g., screen sharing and video recording status) in real-time.

## Challenges and Solutions

Some potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Scalability: To handle increased load, we can implement horizontal scaling using cloud-based infrastructure or load balancing techniques.
* Performance: To maintain performance under high traffic, we can optimize database queries, use caching mechanisms, and implement lazy loading for large datasets.
* Security: To protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, we can implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, use encryption for sensitive data, and restrict access to APIs.

## Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased load and maintain performance, we can:

* Implement horizontal scaling using cloud-based infrastructure or load balancing techniques
* Optimize database queries using efficient indexing and query optimization
* Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database queries
* Implement lazy loading for large datasets to improve page loading times
