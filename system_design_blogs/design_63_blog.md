**Design a Music Streaming Service**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for a music streaming service. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide are:

* User registration and login
* Music catalog browsing and search
* Playlist creation and management
* Audio playback and control (play/pause/seek)
* Social features for sharing playlists and discovering new music

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A user creating a playlist with their favorite songs and sharing it with friends
* A music discovery service recommending songs based on a user's listening history
* A feature to allow users to create and manage their own radio stations

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also consider the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without significant latency or slowdown.
* Scalability: The system should be designed to scale horizontally (add more servers) as the user base grows.
* Reliability: The system should be designed to minimize downtime and ensure high availability.
* Security: The system must protect sensitive data, such as user accounts and audio content.

### High-Level Architecture

The music streaming service architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management
2. **Music Service**: Manages the music catalog, including uploading, storing, and serving audio files
3. **Playlist Service**: Creates, manages, and stores playlists for users
4. **Audio Service**: Handles audio playback and control (play/pause/seek)
5. **Social Service**: Facilitates sharing of playlists and discovery of new music through social features

The components interact as follows:

* The User Service authenticates user requests and passes them to the Music Service for playlist management.
* The Music Service interacts with the Playlist Service to create, update, or retrieve playlists.
* The Audio Service receives audio playback requests from the User Service and plays the requested tracks.
* The Social Service facilitates sharing of playlists between users.

### Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

**users**

| Column | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id (primary key) | int |
| username | varchar |
| email | varchar |
| password_hash | varchar |

**music**

| Column | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id (primary key) | int |
| title | varchar |
| artist | varchar |
| album | varchar |
| duration | int |
| file_path | varchar |

**playlists**

| Column | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id (primary key) | int |
| user_id (foreign key to users) | int |
| name | varchar |
| description | text |

**playlist_items**

| Column | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| id (primary key) | int |
| playlist_id (foreign key to playlists) | int |
| music_id (foreign key to music) | int |
| order | int |

The schema includes the following indexing strategies:

* Index on `users.username` for efficient username lookups
* Index on `music.title` and `music.artist` for efficient music search

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

1. **GET /users**: Returns a list of all users
2. **POST /users**: Creates a new user account
3. **GET /playlists**: Returns a list of playlists for the authenticated user
4. **POST /playlists**: Creates a new playlist for the authenticated user
5. **GET /playlist/{id}**: Returns information about a specific playlist

Example requests and responses:

* `GET /users`: `[{"id": 1, "username": "john", "email": "john@example.com"}]`
* `POST /users`: `{ "message": "User created successfully" }`

### System Flow

The system flow can be illustrated as follows:

```
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  User         |
                                      +---------------+
                                             |
                                             | (1) Register
                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  Music Service  |
                                      |  (catalog, upload)|
                                      +---------------+
                                             |
                                             | (2) Search for music
                                             | or create playlist
                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  Playlist Service|
                                      |  (create, update, retrieve)|
                                      +---------------+
                                             |
                                             | (3) Start audio playback
                                             | and control
                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  Audio Service   |
                                      |  (play/pause/seek)  |
                                      +---------------+
                                             |
                                             | (4) Share playlist or discover new music
                                             | through social features
                                             v
                                      +---------------+
                                      |  Social Service  |
                                      |  (share, recommend)  |
                                      +---------------+
```

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system include:

* Scalability: To ensure the system can handle increased load, we will implement horizontal scaling by adding more servers as needed.
* Security: We will use secure protocols for data transmission and implement access controls to protect sensitive user information.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure the system can handle increased load, we will:

* Implement horizontal scaling by adding more servers as needed
* Use caching mechanisms to reduce database queries and improve response times
* Optimize database schema and indexing strategies for improved query performance

### Security Considerations

The system must protect sensitive data, such as user accounts and audio content. To ensure security, we will:

* Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission
* Implement access controls (e.g., role-based access control) to restrict access to sensitive information
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

### ASCII Diagrams

Here is a simple ASCII diagram illustrating the system architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  User         |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (1) Register
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Music Service  |
          |  (catalog, upload)|
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (2) Search for music
                  | or create playlist
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Playlist Service|
          |  (create, update, retrieve)|
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | (3) Start audio playback
                  | and control
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Audio Service   |
          |  (play/pause/seek)  |
          +---------------+
```

### Conclusion
