**Design a Real-time Stock Market Dashboard**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for a real-time stock market dashboard. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The core functionalities the system must provide include:

* Real-time stock prices and market data
* Interactive charts and graphs for visualizing market trends
* Support for multiple markets and exchanges (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)
* User authentication and authorization for personalized dashboards
* Alerts and notifications for significant price movements or events

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A trader monitoring stock prices and market trends in real-time to make informed investment decisions
* An investor tracking their portfolio performance and receiving alerts for potential gains or losses
* A financial analyst analyzing market data to identify trends and patterns

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: The system must be able to handle a large volume of requests and queries without significant latency or downtime.
* Scalability: The system must be able to scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growing user demand and increasing data volumes.
* Reliability: The system must have high uptime and availability to ensure continuous operation.
* Security: The system must protect sensitive financial information and prevent unauthorized access.

### High-Level Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: This layer is responsible for collecting and processing real-time market data from various sources (e.g., exchanges, APIs).
2. **Data Processing Layer**: This layer performs data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare data for storage and querying.
3. **Database**: The system uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store the processed data.
4. **API Gateway**: This layer provides a single entry point for clients to access the system's APIs and services.
5. **Web Application Layer**: This layer handles user requests, interacts with the API gateway, and renders the dashboard.

### Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Stocks**:
	* Stock ID (primary key)
	* Symbol
	* Name
	* Market (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)
2. **Market Data**:
	* Stock ID (foreign key referencing Stocks table)
	* Date and Time (timestamp)
	* Open Price
	* High Price
	* Low Price
	* Close Price
3. **User Accounts**:
	* User ID (primary key)
	* Username
	* Password (hashed for security)
4. **Alerts**:
	* Alert ID (primary key)
	* Stock ID (foreign key referencing Stocks table)
	* Condition (e.g., price above/below a certain threshold)
	* Trigger Time

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

1. `GET /stocks`: Retrieve a list of available stocks and their market data.
2. `GET /stock/{symbol}`: Retrieve the market data for a specific stock symbol.
3. `POST /alerts`: Create a new alert with a specified condition (e.g., price above/below a certain threshold).
4. `GET /alerts`: Retrieve a list of active alerts and their conditions.

Example requests and responses:

* `GET /stocks`:
	+ Request: `GET http://api.example.com/stocks`
	+ Response: `[{"symbol": "AAPL", "name": "Apple Inc.", ...}, {"symbol": "MSFT", "name": "Microsoft Corp.", ...}]`
* `GET /stock/AAPL`:
	+ Request: `GET http://api.example.com/stock/AAPL`
	+ Response: `[{"date": "2023-02-15 14:30:00", "open": 150.50, "high": 152.25, ...}, ...]`

### OpenAPI Specification

  /stock/{symbol}:
    get:
      summary: Retrieve the market data for a specific stock symbol.
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: symbol
          required: true
          schema:

                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/MarketData'
```

### System Flow

The system flow consists of the following components:

1. Data Ingestion Layer: Collects and processes real-time market data from various sources.
2. Data Processing Layer: Performs data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare data for storage and querying.
3. Database: Stores the processed data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
4. API Gateway: Provides a single entry point for clients to access the system's APIs and services.
5. Web Application Layer: Handles user requests, interacts with the API gateway, and renders the dashboard.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges include:

* Handling high volumes of real-time market data
* Ensuring data accuracy and consistency
* Scalability and performance under heavy load
* Security measures to protect sensitive financial information

Solutions:

* Use a scalable data ingestion layer to handle high volumes of data.
* Implement robust data processing and normalization techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
* Design the system for horizontal scaling and use caching mechanisms to improve performance.
* Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as encryption for data transmission.

### Scalability and Performance

Strategies to ensure scalability and performance include:

* Horizontal scaling: Add more instances of the data ingestion layer and API gateway to handle increased load.
* Caching: Use caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the system.
* Load balancing: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the system to ensure even performance.
