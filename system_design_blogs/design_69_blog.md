**Design a Crowdfunding Platform**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for a crowdfunding platform. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The crowdfunding platform must provide the following core functionalities:

* Users can create campaigns for fundraising or supporting existing projects
* Campaigns can be categorized by type (e.g., charity, business, personal)
* Users can pledge funds to support their favorite campaigns
* Pledged funds are tracked and updated in real-time
* Campaign owners receive notifications when new pledges are made

Specific use cases:

* A non-profit organization raises funds for a community project through the platform
* An artist creates a campaign to fund an album release through the platform

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also consider performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes. For example:

* The system should be able to handle a large volume of traffic without significant degradation in performance
* The system should be highly available, with minimal downtime for maintenance or upgrades
* The system should ensure the security and integrity of user data

### High-Level Architecture

The crowdfunding platform will consist of the following components:

* Frontend: A web-based interface for users to create campaigns, pledge funds, and track progress
* Backend: A server-side application that handles API requests, processes transactions, and stores data in a database
* Database: A relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores campaign information, user profiles, and transaction history

The components will interact as follows:

1. Users create campaigns or pledge funds through the frontend.
2. The frontend sends API requests to the backend to process these actions.
3. The backend processes the requests, updates the database, and sends notifications to relevant parties (e.g., campaign owners).
4. The database stores all data, including campaign information, user profiles, and transaction history.

### Database Schema

The following tables will be created in the RDBMS:

* **campaigns**: Campaign ID, title, description, category, start date, end date
* **users**: User ID, username, email, password (hashed)
* **pledges**: Pledge ID, campaign ID, user ID, amount, status (pending, approved, rejected)
* **transactions**: Transaction ID, campaign ID, user ID, amount, timestamp

Relationships:

* A campaign can have multiple pledges.
* A pledge is associated with one campaign and one user.
* A transaction is related to one campaign and one user.

Indexing strategies:

* Index the campaigns table on the category column for efficient querying by category.
* Index the pledges table on the status column for efficient filtering by status.

### API Design

The crowdfunding platform will expose the following key endpoints through its API:

* **create_campaign**: Creates a new campaign with provided details (title, description, category).
* **get_campaigns**: Retrieves a list of campaigns, filtered by category or start date.
* **pledge_funds**: Processes a pledge for a specified campaign and user.
* **get_pledges**: Retrieves a list of pledges for a specified campaign.

Example requests and responses:

* `POST /create_campaign` with JSON payload: `{ "title": "My New Album", "description": "Support my music project" }`
	+ Response: `201 Created` with campaign ID
* `GET /get_campaigns?category=charity` with no payload
	+ Response: `200 OK` with a list of charity campaigns

### OpenAPI Specification

The crowdfunding platform will use the OpenAPI specification to define its API. The spec will include:

* Definitions for campaign, user, and pledge data types
* Endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating campaigns and pledges
* Request and response examples for each endpoint

### System Flow

Data flow through the system:

1. Users create or update campaigns on the frontend.
2. The frontend sends API requests to the backend to process these actions.
3. The backend processes the requests, updates the database, and sends notifications to relevant parties (e.g., campaign owners).
4. The database stores all data, including campaign information, user profiles, and transaction history.

Control flow through the system:

1. The frontend validates user input before sending API requests.
2. The backend validates and processes API requests, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
3. The database enforces relationships between tables to ensure data correctness.

### Challenges and Solutions

Potential challenges in designing and implementing the system:

* Scalability: As the platform grows, it may need to handle a large volume of traffic without significant degradation in performance.
	+ Solution: Use load balancing and caching mechanisms to distribute requests across multiple servers.
* Security: The system must protect sensitive user data and prevent fraudulent activity.
	+ Solution: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as regular security audits and penetration testing.

### Scalability and Performance

Strategies for ensuring the system can handle increased load and maintain performance:

* Load balancing: Distribute requests across multiple servers to reduce the load on individual machines.
* Caching: Store frequently accessed data in memory or a cache layer to reduce database queries.
* Database sharding: Partition large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve query performance.

### Security Considerations

Security measures to protect the system and its data:

* Authentication and authorization: Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
* Data encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES).
* Regular security audits and penetration testing: Perform regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and implement patches.

### ASCII Diagrams

Here is a simple ASCII diagram illustrating the system architecture:
```
          +---------------+
          |  Frontend   |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | API requests
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Backend    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  | Database
                  | queries
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Database  |
          +---------------+
```
### Sample SQL Schema

SQL script for creating the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE campaigns (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  category VARCHAR(50),
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  password VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE pledges (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status VARCHAR(20),
  FOREIGN KEY (campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id INTEGER,
  user_id INTEGER,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  timestamp DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (campaign_id) REFERENCES campaigns(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
