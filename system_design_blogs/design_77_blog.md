**Design a Virtual Try-On System for E-commerce**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a virtual try-on system for e-commerce. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

The virtual try-on system must provide the following core functionalities:

* Allow users to upload their 3D avatar or scan themselves using AR technology
* Offer a selection of products from various e-commerce platforms
* Enable users to virtually try on products and see how they would look in real-time
* Provide a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to purchase products directly from the virtual try-on platform

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* Users trying on different outfits for a special occasion (e.g., prom, wedding)
* Fashion-conscious individuals wanting to preview new product releases before making a purchase
* Individuals with disabilities who may not be able to physically try on clothing in-store

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet the following non-functional requirements:

* Performance: respond quickly to user interactions and minimize latency
* Scalability: handle a large number of concurrent users and product offerings
* Reliability: ensure data integrity and availability with minimal downtime
* Security: protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or tampering

### High-Level Architecture

The virtual try-on system will consist of the following key components:

1. User Interface (UI) - responsible for rendering the virtual try-on experience, including 3D avatars and product visualizations.
2. Product Database - stores information about available products, including images, descriptions, and metadata.
3. Computer Vision API - processes user input data (e.g., photos of users' faces or bodies) to create a 3D avatar.
4. AR/VR Engine - enables real-time rendering of virtual try-on experiences using AR or VR technology.
5. Order Management System (OMS) - handles order processing and fulfillment.
6. Payment Gateway - facilitates secure payment transactions.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:

```
          +---------------+
          |  User Interface  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | Computer Vision API|
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | AR/VR Engine    |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | Product Database |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | OMS              |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  (API)
                  v
          +---------------+
          | Payment Gateway  |
          +---------------+
```

### Database Schema

The product database schema will include the following tables and relationships:

**Products**

* `id` (primary key): unique identifier for each product
* `name`: product name
* `description`: product description
* `image_url`: URL of product image
* `metadata`: additional product metadata (e.g., size, color, material)

**Product_Variants**

* `product_id` (foreign key): references the `Products` table
* `variant_name`: variant name (e.g., "Small", "Medium", "Large")
* `image_url`: URL of variant image

**Orders**

* `id` (primary key): unique identifier for each order
* `user_id` (foreign key): references the user's ID
* `product_id` (foreign key): references the `Products` table
* `quantity`: quantity of product ordered
* `total_price`: total price of order

Indexing strategies will include:

* Primary keys on `id` columns for efficient lookup and retrieval.
* Indexes on `product_id` and `user_id` columns to facilitate fast joins and queries.

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints:

1. `/upload_avatar`: uploads a user's 3D avatar or scans themselves using AR technology.
2. `/try_on`: enables users to virtually try on products in real-time.
3. `/order`: processes order requests and updates the Order Management System.
4. `/payment`: facilitates secure payment transactions.

Example requests and responses:

* `POST /upload_avatar`:
	+ Request body: JSON object containing user's 3D avatar or AR scan data
	+ Response: JSON object with uploaded avatar ID and metadata
* `GET /try_on?product_id=123&avatar_id=456`:
	+ Request parameters: product ID and avatar ID
	+ Response: JSON object with virtual try-on experience (AR/VR rendering)

### OpenAPI Specification

The following is an example OpenAPI spec for the API:
