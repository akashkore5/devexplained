**Design a Smart Waste Management System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Smart Waste Management". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

* Clearly outline the core functionalities the system must provide:
	+ Real-time monitoring of waste levels in bins
	+ Automated collection scheduling based on fill levels
	+ Integration with municipal waste management systems for efficient routing and logistics
	+ User-friendly mobile app for reporting issues and requesting pickups
* Specific use cases or scenarios:
	+ Residents can report full trash cans through the mobile app, triggering automated collection schedules.
	+ Waste management teams can access real-time data to optimize routes and reduce fuel consumption.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

* Discuss performance, scalability, reliability, and other quality attributes:
	+ System must handle high traffic volumes during peak usage hours
	+ Data accuracy is critical for effective waste management decisions
	+ High availability is required to minimize downtime and service disruptions

### High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

* **Waste Management API**: Handles requests from mobile app, municipal systems, and other stakeholders.
* **Data Analytics Engine**: Processes data from sensors, GPS, and other sources for real-time monitoring and analysis.
* **Scheduling Algorithm**: Automates collection scheduling based on fill levels and priority.
* **Municipal Integration Layer**: Facilitates seamless exchange of data with municipal waste management systems.

### Database Schema

The system will require a database to store and manage data. The schema will include the following tables:

* **Waste Bins**:
	+ Bin ID
	+ Location (GPS coordinates)
	+ Fill Level (percentage)
	+ Last Pickup Time (datetime)
* **Collection Schedules**:
	+ Schedule ID
	+ Bin ID
	+ Collection Date and Time (datetime)
	+ Priority Level (1-5, with 5 being highest priority)
* **Municipal Integration Data**:
	+ Municipal System ID
	+ Route Information (GPS coordinates and schedule data)

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

* `GET /bins`: Returns a list of waste bins with their current fill levels.
* `POST /report-issue`: Allows users to report issues or request pickups through the mobile app.
* `GET /collection-schedules`: Retrieves scheduled collection times for specific bins.

#### OpenAPI Specification

Here is an example OpenAPI spec for the API:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: Smart Waste Management System API
  description: Provides APIs for waste management system integration and monitoring.
paths:
  /bins:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of waste bins with their current fill levels.
      responses:
        200:
          description: List of waste bins with fill levels
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/WasteBin'
    post:
      summary: Allows users to report issues or request pickups through the mobile app.
      requestBody:
        description: Report issue or request pickup request
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                binId:
                  type: integer
                issueDescription:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: Issue reported or pickup scheduled
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  message:
                    type: string
```
### System Flow

The system flow will involve the following steps:

1. Mobile app users report issues or request pickups through the API.
2. The Waste Management API processes requests and updates the database accordingly.
3. The Data Analytics Engine analyzes real-time data to determine optimal collection schedules.
4. The Scheduling Algorithm automates collection scheduling based on fill levels and priority.
5. Municipal Integration Layer facilitates seamless exchange of data with municipal waste management systems.

### Challenges and Solutions

* **Data accuracy**: Ensure accurate data by implementing robust data validation and quality control mechanisms.
* **Scalability**: Design the system to handle increased traffic and load during peak usage hours.
* **Security**: Implement robust security measures, such as encryption and access controls, to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure scalability and performance:

* Use a cloud-based infrastructure for flexible scaling and reliability.
* Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on databases and improve response times.
* Optimize database queries and indexing strategies to minimize latency.

### Security Considerations

To ensure security:

* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive data.
* Encrypt all data transmitted between components, including APIs and mobile apps.
* Regularly update software and systems to address known vulnerabilities.

### Sample SQL Schema

Here is an example SQL script for creating the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Waste_Bins (
  Bin_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Location VARCHAR(255),
  Fill_Level DECIMAL(3,2),
  Last_Pickup_Time DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE Collection_Schedules (
  Schedule_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Bin_ID INT,
  Collection_Date_TIME DATETIME,
  Priority_LEVEL INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (Bin_ID) REFERENCES Waste_Bins(Bin_ID)
);
```
### Example JSON API Response

Here is an example JSON response for the `GET /bins` endpoint:
```json
[
  {
    "Bin_ID": 1,
    "Location": "123 Main St",
    "Fill_Level": 0.8,
    "Last_Pickup_Time": "2023-02-15 14:30:00"
  },
  {
    "Bin_ID": 2,
    "Location": "456 Elm St",
    "Fill_Level": 0.5,
    "Last_Pickup_Time": "2023-02-12 10:45:00"
  }
]
