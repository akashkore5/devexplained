## **Introduction**

As the world becomes increasingly digital, the importance of crawling and indexing websites has never been more crucial. A web crawler, also known as a spider or bot, is a software application that automatically navigates the internet to gather information from various sources. This process involves scraping data from targeted websites, processing the gathered data, and storing it in a database for future use.

In this blog post, we will delve into the design of a web crawler system architecture, focusing on its high-level and low-level designs, scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.

## **Problem Statement**

The primary problem being solved is designing an efficient and scalable web crawler that can handle large amounts of data from various sources while maintaining data integrity and consistency. The web crawler should be able to:

1. Extract relevant information (e.g., text, images) from target websites.
2. Handle different website structures and formatting.
3. Process gathered data efficiently for storage or further analysis.
4. Scale horizontally as the need arises.

## **High-Level Design (HLD)**

### Overview of the System Architecture

The web crawler system consists of several microservices working together to achieve its objectives:

1. **Crawler Service**: Responsible for navigating and extracting information from target websites.
2. **Data Processor**: Handles data processing, filtering, and transformation.
3. **Database Service**: Stores processed data in a database for future use.

### Microservices

* **Crawler Service**:
	+ Responsible for sending HTTP requests to target websites and parsing HTML responses.
	+ Handles website crawling and data extraction (e.g., text, images).
* **Data Processor**:
	+ Processes gathered data by filtering, transforming, and cleaning it.
	+ Applies business logic to extracted data (e.g., sentiment analysis, entity recognition).

### API Gateway

We will use AWS API Gateway as our API gateway. It provides a scalable and secure entry point for incoming requests.

### Load Balancing Strategy

To ensure high availability and scalability, we will employ Round-Robin load balancing across multiple instances of the Crawler Service.

### Caching Strategy

We will utilize Redis as our caching layer to store frequently accessed data. This will help reduce the number of database queries and improve system performance.

### Rate Limiting Approach

To prevent abuse and overload, we will implement a token bucket rate limiting approach using AWS Lambda functions.

### Database Selection

We will use PostgreSQL as our relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing processed data. For large-scale data processing, MongoDB or Cassandra could be used.

```

## **Low-Level Design (LLD)**

### Crawler Service

* `crawlWebsite(websiteUrl)`: Sends an HTTP request to the target website and parses the HTML response.
* `extractData(htmlResponse)`: Extracts relevant information from the parsed HTML response.

### Data Processor

* `processData(data)`: Applies business logic to extracted data (e.g., sentiment analysis, entity recognition).
* `transformData(data)`: Transforms processed data into a desired format for storage or further analysis.

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE crawled_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    website_url VARCHAR(255),
    data TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### API Endpoints (in Java)

```java
@RestController
public class CrawlerController {
    
    @PostMapping("/crawl")
    public ResponseEntity<String> crawlWebsite(@RequestBody WebsiteRequest request) {
        // Send HTTP request to target website and parse HTML response
        String htmlResponse = crawlerService.crawl(request.getWebsiteUrl());
        
        // Extract relevant information from parsed HTML response
        String data = extractor.extractData(htmlResponse);
        
        return ResponseEntity.ok(data);
    }
}
```

### System Flow

1. Receive a `WebsiteRequest` object containing the target website URL.
2. Send an HTTP request to the target website and parse the HTML response using the Crawler Service.
3. Extract relevant information from the parsed HTML response using the Data Processor.
4. Process the extracted data by applying business logic (e.g., sentiment analysis, entity recognition).
5. Store the processed data in the PostgreSQL Database.

## **Scalability and Performance**

To ensure scalability and performance:

* Horizontal scaling: Increase the number of instances for each microservice as needed.
* Data sharding: Partition large datasets across multiple databases or nodes to improve read and write performance.

## **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**

Strategies for handling failures:

* Circuit breakers: Monitor request latency and frequency, and automatically disable failing services.
* Retries: Implement retry mechanisms to handle temporary failures and maintain system availability.

Data consistency:

* Eventual consistency: Allow some degree of inconsistency in data storage to ensure high availability.
* Strong consistency: Ensure data consistency at the cost of higher latency or reduced availability.

## **Conclusion**

In this blog post, we designed a web crawler system architecture that is scalable, reliable, and fault-tolerant. We explored the high-level design, low-level design, scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance strategies for our web crawler system. By applying these principles, you can build a robust and efficient web crawler that meets your specific requirements.

**Summary**

In summary, designing a web crawler involves:

1. Identifying the problem being solved (e.g., extracting relevant information from target websites).
2. Designing a scalable and reliable architecture (e.g., microservices, API Gateway, load balancing, caching, rate limiting).
3. Implementing data processing and transformation logic.
4. Ensuring system flow and fault tolerance through circuit breakers, retries, and data consistency strategies.
