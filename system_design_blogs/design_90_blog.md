**Design a Smart Home Security System**

## Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a system for "Design a Smart Home Security System". The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

The smart home security system must provide the following core functionalities:

* Real-time monitoring and alerting for intrusions, motion detection, and door opening
* Integration with various sensors (e.g., cameras, motion detectors, door sensors) and alarm systems
* User authentication and access control for remote monitoring and configuration
* Notifications to homeowners and authorities in case of an incident

Specific use cases or scenarios include:

* A homeowner receiving a notification on their smartphone when an intruder is detected at their front door.
* An elderly person being able to remotely monitor and control the security system from their tablet.

### Non-Functional Requirements

The system must also meet certain non-functional requirements, including:

* Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of simultaneous requests without significant latency or degradation in service.
* Scalability: As more users and sensors are added, the system should be able to scale horizontally or vertically without compromising performance.
* Reliability: The system must be designed to minimize downtime and ensure that critical functions remain available even in case of component failures.

## High-Level Architecture

The smart home security system architecture consists of several key components:

* **Sensor Hub**: Collects data from various sensors (e.g., cameras, motion detectors, door sensors) and sends it to the cloud for processing.
* **Cloud Processing**: Analyzes sensor data using machine learning algorithms to detect potential intrusions or anomalies.
* **Notification System**: Sends alerts and notifications to homeowners, authorities, and other stakeholders in case of an incident.
* **User Interface**: Provides a web-based interface for users to monitor and configure the system remotely.

        +---------------+
        | Web-Based UI    |
        +---------------+
```

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables and relationships:

* **Sensors**: Table containing information about individual sensors (e.g., camera IDs, motion detector IDs)
* **Sensor Readings**: Table storing sensor data with timestamps and corresponding sensor IDs
* **Incidents**: Table recording incidents detected by the system (e.g., intrusions, anomalies)

Indexing strategies include:

* Primary key on Sensor Readings table for efficient querying
* Index on Incident table for fast lookup of recent incidents

    |  description |
    +----------------+
```

## API Design

### Key Endpoints

The system provides the following main API endpoints:

* **GET /sensors**: Retrieves a list of available sensors
* **POST /sensor-readings**: Sends sensor data to the cloud for processing
* **GET /incidents**: Retrieves a list of recent incidents detected by the system
* **PUT /config**: Updates user configuration and preferences

Example requests and responses:

* **GET /sensors**:
```json
[
  {
    "sensor_id": 1,
    "sensor_type": "camera"
  },
  {
    "sensor_id": 2,
    "sensor_type": "motion_detector"
  }
]
```

* **POST /sensor-readings**:
```json
{
  "reading_id": 123,
  "timestamp": "2023-02-20T14:30:00Z",
  "sensor_id": 1,
  "data": [
    {"camera_id": 1, "image_data": [...]}
  ]
}
```

### OpenAPI Specification

Here is the OpenAPI spec for the API:
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.2

## System Flow

The system flow involves the following components and interactions:

1. Sensor Hub collects sensor data and sends it to the Cloud Processing component.
2. Cloud Processing analyzes sensor data using machine learning algorithms to detect potential intrusions or anomalies.
3. The Notification System sends alerts and notifications to homeowners, authorities, and other stakeholders in case of an incident.
4. The User Interface provides a web-based interface for users to monitor and configure the system remotely.
