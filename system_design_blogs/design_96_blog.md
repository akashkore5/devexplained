**Design a Smart Air Quality Monitoring System**

### Introduction

In this document, we will explore the design of a smart air quality monitoring system. The goal is to understand the requirements, challenges, and architectural decisions involved in building such a system.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

* Monitor and record air quality data from various sensors
* Provide real-time updates on air quality levels
* Offer alerts and notifications when air quality exceeds safe thresholds
* Allow users to view historical air quality data and trends
* Support multiple sensor types, including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3)

#### Non-Functional Requirements

* Performance: handle high volumes of data without compromising system responsiveness
* Scalability: accommodate increased user demand and sensor data without affecting system performance
* Reliability: ensure the system remains operational even in the event of sensor failures or communication disruptions
* Security: protect sensitive air quality data and prevent unauthorized access

### High-Level Architecture

The smart air quality monitoring system consists of three main components:

1. **Sensors**: Collect air quality data from various sources, including PM, NO2, and O3 sensors.
2. **Data Processing Hub**: Processes sensor data, applies algorithms for data cleaning and validation, and stores data in a database.
3. **Web Interface**: Provides users with real-time air quality updates, historical data, and alerts.

### Database Schema

The system uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the following schema:

**Sensors**

| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Sensor ID | int |
| Sensor Type | varchar(255) |
| Location | varchar(255) |

**Air Quality Data**

| Column Name | Data Type |
| --- | --- |
| Air Quality Reading ID | int |
| Sensor ID | int |
| Date and Time | datetime |
| PM Level | float |
| NO2 Level | float |
| O3 Level | float |

### API Design

#### Key Endpoints

* `GET /air-quality`: Returns the current air quality reading for a specific location.
* `GET /historical-data`: Retrieves historical air quality data for a specified time period and location.
* `POST /alert`: Sends an alert when air quality exceeds safe thresholds.

```
### System Flow

1. Sensors collect air quality data and send it to the Data Processing Hub.
2. The Data Processing Hub processes sensor data, applies algorithms for data cleaning and validation, and stores data in the database.
3. Users request air quality data or historical data through the Web Interface.
4. The system retrieves relevant data from the database and returns it to the user.

### Challenges and Solutions

* **Data Validation**: Implement robust data validation to ensure accurate and reliable air quality readings.
* **Sensor Calibration**: Regularly calibrate sensors to maintain accuracy and prevent drift.
* **Scalability**: Use load balancing, caching, and horizontal scaling to handle increased traffic and sensor data.

### Scalability and Performance

To ensure scalability and performance:

* Use cloud-based infrastructure for easy scalability.
* Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database queries.
* Utilize load balancing and content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute traffic and improve response times.

### Security Considerations

* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive air quality data both in transit and at rest using secure protocols like HTTPS.
* **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access air quality data.
* **Regular Backups**: Regularly backup critical system components to prevent data loss in the event of a disaster.

       |  Sensors     |
       +---------------+
```
### Sample SQL Schema

Here is a sample SQL script to create the database schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensors (
  sensor_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  sensor_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE air_quality_data (
  air_quality_reading_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  sensor_id INT NOT NULL,
  date_and_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
  pm_level FLOAT NOT NULL,
  no2_level FLOAT NOT NULL,
  o3_level FLOAT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (sensor_id) REFERENCES sensors(sensor_id)
);
```
### Example JSON API Response

Here is an example JSON response for the `/air-quality` endpoint:
```json
{
  "airQuality": {
    "pmLevel": 12.5,
    "no2Level": 0.3,
    "o3Level": 0.1,
    "location": "New York City"
  }
}
```
